<p class='pindent'>These stories of dreams and delights in breathless jungles
of Ceylon, among Himalayan mountains, by Chinese seas,
in ancientries beneath dead suns and withered moons, are in
truth the soul’s longing to behold the White Swan of the
World when in dim twilights of dawn and evening she
spreads her wings for flight. And because to such wings
time and distance are nothing I have gathered one feather
dropped on Dartmoor as she soared to Gaurisankar where
on the highest peak of earth, circled by great stars, the
Mystic Mother of India dreams her divine dream as the
ages unroll beneath her feet. The Snowy Goddess, She who
is Very Woman of very woman, knows that whether by
Thames or Ganges, Mississippi, Yang-tze, or rolling Nile,
Her daughters are the same, yesterday, to-day and for ever,
and holding in their hands the hearts of men, so fulfil Her
purpose. And because no true story can be told without
this knowledge, I set Her name at the beginning of these
dreams and delights, invoking devoutly the protection and
inspiration of Her who is at once Eve and Lilith, Athene and
Aphrodite, Parwati and Kali, Virgin, Mother, and Destroyer,
but in all forms and incarnations, Enchantress and Conqueror
of men.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:10em;font-size:1.2em;'>“V. LYDIAT”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch1'>“V. LYDIAT”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>She sat and looked at the signature written under the
name of the story in readiness for typing.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“THE NINEFOLD FLOWER.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fine story, she knew, and the signature satisfied her
also as it always did. <span class='it'>V.</span> is the most beautiful letter in the
alphabet to write and look at, the ends curving over from
the slender base like the uprush of a fountain from its tense
spring. When she “commenced author,” as the eighteenth
century puts it, she devoted days and days to the consideration
of that pen-name. For several reasons it must not reveal
identity. Most women prefer the highwayman’s mask
when they ride abroad to hold up the public. It gives a
freedom impossible when one is tethered to the responsibilities
of name and family. One becomes a foundling in
the great city of Literature and the pebble-cold eye of human
relationship passes unaware over what would have stung
it into anger or jealousy if it had held the key of the
mystery. That is, if the secret is guarded as carefully as
V. Lydiat’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, for all I know, her strange reason for secrecy may
never in this world have swayed man or woman before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality she was Beatrice Veronica Law Leslie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mouthful indeed! You can make as many combinations
with that as with the trick lock of a safe, and it will be
as difficult to pick the secret. She had a strong superstition
about keeping to her own initials, anagrammed or reversed
and twisted. It seemed to her that this was part of a bond
of honour of which another held the pledge. With this pen-name
a most astonishing thing had befallen Beatrice
Veronica Law Leslie, for she won a literary success so sudden
and singular that the very management of it required a
statesmanship she never before knew she possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little must here be said of her life that this strange
thing may be understood. She was the only child of a well-known
Oxford don and a somewhat remarkable mystically-minded
mother who died when the girl was fourteen. Her
father, after that loss, “tried life a little, liked it not, and
died” four years later, and Beatrice Veronica who was known
in her family as B. V. then betook herself to the guardianship
of an aunt in Montreal. Here, she also tried life a
little, on the society side, and certainly liked it not. There
was an urge within her that cried aloud for adventure, for
the sight of the dissolving glories of the Orient and contact
with strange lives that called to her dumbly in books.
They peeped and mocked and vanished to their unknown
countries taking her longing with them, and life lay about
her vapid, flat, dominated by an Aunt of Fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She floated on a duck pond and sighed for the ocean.
What is a young woman of spirit, not too beautiful to be
dangerous, of small but sufficient means, to do in such a
case? Beatrice Veronica knew very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waited until she was twenty-one, meanwhile securing
the allegiance of a girl, Sidney Verrier, in like case, an enthusiast
like herself, and on a May morning of dreamy sweetness
they got themselves into a C.P.R. train for Victoria, B.
C., leaving two ill-auguring aunts on the platform, and away
with them on a trip to the Orient <span class='it'>via</span> Japan. They were
under bond to return in a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wonderful, a heavenly experience—that wander-year
of theirs. The things they saw, the men and women
they met, the marvels which appealed to every sense! But
I must not dwell on these for they are but the pedestal to
the story of V. Lydiat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year! Impossible. Four, six, eight years went by and
still unheeded aunts clamoured, and the pavements of
Montreal lacked their footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, in Agra, Sidney Verrier married, and apologetically,
doubtfully, dissolved the fair companionship, and
Beatrice Veronica was left to solitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the bridal car rolled off to the station and the
honeymoon at Mussoori, she sat down and considered. She
had not realized it until then. The ways of the world were
open, for experience had made them plain. She had acquaintances,
go where she would. There was no material
reason why she should not continue this delightful nomad
existence delightfully. But she was lonely, and suddenly
it became clear to her that she wanted quiet, time,
recollection. She had assisted at a great feast of the senses
and had eaten to satiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now—imperatively—something in her heart cried
“Enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards she wondered if that had been the voice of
V. Lydiat crying in the wilderness. The note of preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But where to go? Her aunt was still treading the daily
round of bridge and luncheon parties in Montreal and the
soul of Beatrice Veronica shuddered in the remembrance.
No, no. The bird set free does not re-enter its gilded cage,
however temptingly the little dish of seed is set forth. But
she loved Canada for all that. She remembered, as she and
Sidney Verrier had passed through the glorious giant-land
of the Rockies, how broadly uplifted and vast had been the
heights and spaces, how enormous the glee of the rivers
tumbling from hidden sources, and they called her across
far waters and beneath strange stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But could one live in such colossal companionship? Is
it possible to dine and sleep and yawn in the presence of
Gods and Emperors? There was the doubt. And then she
remembered a shining city laving her feet in shining seas,
with quiet gardens where the roses blush and bloom in a
calm so deep that you may count the fall of every petal in
the drowsy summer afternoons. A city of pines and oaks,
of happy homes great and small,—a city above all, bearing
the keys of the Orient at her golden girdle,—for it is but to
step aboard a boat, swift almost as the Magic Carpet, and
you wake one happy morning with all the dear remembered
scents and sights before you once more. And her heart said
“Victoria,”—where Westernmost West leans forward to kiss
Easternmost East across the Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she went there—now a woman of twenty-nine, self-possessed,
and capable, and settled herself in a great hostelry
to choose and build her home. Her home, mark you!—not
her prison. It was not to be so large as to hamper flight
when the inevitable call came—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Take down your golden wings now</p>
<p class='line0'>From the hook behind the door,</p>

<p class='line0'>And you must fly once more.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>I wish I might write of the building of Beatrice Veronica’s
home for it developed into one of the immense joys of her
life. But more important things are ahead, so it must
suffice to say that it was long, low and brown with sunny
verandas and windows avid of sunshine, and that all the
plunder of travel, and books, books, books found happy
place in it and grew there as inevitably as leaves on a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was while all this was in embryo that the thought of
writing impressed itself on Beatrice Veronica. Partly because
the house adventure was expensive and she wanted a
larger margin, partly because she had seen with delighted
interest and intelligence all the splendid spectacle of men and
cities. Her sound knowledge of history and cultivated taste
in literature should count for pebbles in the writer’s sling
who goes forth to conquer the great Goliath of the public.
She revolved this thought often as she walked by murmurous
seas or nested in a niche of rock to watch the mountains
opposite reflecting every change of sunlight as a soul in
adoration reflects its deity. It really seemed a waste not to
turn all this to some sort of account. And success would be
sweet. But how to begin!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bought an armful of the magazines which make gay
the streets of Victoria. “I ought to be able to do this kind of
thing,” she reflected. “I have a good vocabulary. Father
always thought about eight thousand words, and that should
go a long way. Besides I’ve seen nearly all there is to see.
Let’s try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did, and ended with more respect for the average
author. The eight thousand were as unmanageable as mutineers
or idiots. They marched doggedly in heavy columns,
they right-about-faced and deployed; but there was
no life in them. The veriest man-handler of a grizzly or a
cow-boy could do better. Being a young person of quick
insight and decision she decided to waste no more time in
that direction. She laid away the magazines and decided
to be a spectator with memory and hope for companions.
She burned her manuscripts and turned her attention to
planning her garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was then that V. Lydiat dawned on the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawned. That is the only word, for it came and the sun
came after. It happened in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night, in the usual way Beatrice Veronica fell asleep
and dreamed, but not in the usual way. She was standing
by a temple she remembered very well in Southern India,
the Temple of Govindhar. It stood there, under its palms
wonderful as a giant rock of majolica, coloured lavishly in
the hard fierce sunshine, monstrously sculptured with gods
and goddesses, and mythical creatures of land and water in
all the acts of their supernal life, writhing and tapering upwards
to the great architectural crown supported by tigers
and monkeys which finished the building,—a crown gemmed
with worshipping spirits for jewels, a nightmare conception
of violence in form and colour; the last barbaric touch to
the misbegotten splendour. Vaguely the whole thing reminded
Beatrice Veronica of her literary efforts and she
stood among the palms looking up to the blaze against the
blue and smiling a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she became aware that a man was standing near
the great gate which no unbeliever’s foot may pass, looking
up also, shading his eyes with his hand from the intolerable
sunlight. His face was sensitive and strong, an unusual
blending, his eyes grey and noticeable. She liked his figure
in the light tropical clothing. He had the air of birth and
breeding. But he seemed wearied, as if the climate had
been too much for him, a look one knows very well where
the Peninsula runs down to Cape Cormorin, and the sun
beats on the head like a mighty man of valour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as dream-people will, he came towards her as if they
had known each other all their lives, and said, slowly, meditatively:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have tried and tried. I can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sense that she knew what he meant though she
could not drag it to the surface, she found herself saying
earnestly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have you tried hard enough? <span class='it'>Really</span> tried?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hands to his forehead with a tired gesture:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m always trying. But <span class='it'>you</span> could do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said, “Could I?” in great astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood a moment side by side, looking at each other
and then as if from a blurred distance she heard his voice
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was said long ago that if any creatures united their
psychic forces they could conquer the world, though singly
they could do nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Temple and palms dissolved into coloured mist; they
swam away on another wave of dream and vanished. She
floated up to the surface of consciousness again, awake, with
the pale morning gold streaming in through the east window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew she had dreamed, for a sense of something lost
haunted her all day, yet could not remember anything, and
things went on in their usual course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening sitting in a corner of the hotel lounge, with
the babble of music and talk about her, she had the irresistible
impulse to write,—to write something; she did not in the
least know what. It was so urgent that she walked quickly
to the elevator and so to her sitting room, and there she
snatched pen and paper and wrote the beginning of a story
of modern life in India, but strangely influenced by and
centring about the Temple of Govindhar. As she wrote the
name she remembered that she had seen it among the palm
trees in its hideous beauty, and now, like a human personality,
it forced itself upon her and compelled her to be its
mouthpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How it happened she could not in the least tell. Certainly
she had travelled, kept her ears and eyes open and
learned as much as any woman can do who keeps on the
beaten track in the Orient and consorts with her own kind
in preference to the natives. The two worlds are very far
apart—so far that nothing from below the surface can pass
over the well-defined limits. Moreover she was not a
learned woman,—Indian thought of the mystic order had
never come her way, and Indian history except at the point
where it touches European was a closed book. Therefore
this story astonished her very much. She read it over
breathlessly when it was finished. If she had had that
knowledge when she was there how all the mysteries of the
temple would have leaped to light—what drama, what
strange suspense would have lurked in its monstrous form
and colour! The critic in her brain who, standing aside,
watched the posturing and mouthing of the characters, told
her austerely that the work was good—excellent. But
something behind her brain had told her that already. She
read it over ardently, lingeringly, with an astonishing sense
of ownership yet of doubt. <span class='it'>How</span> had it come? And the
writing? No longer did the eight thousand of her vocabulary
march in dull squadrons, heavy-footed, languid. They
sped, ran, flew, with perfect grace, like the dancers of
princes. They were beautiful exceedingly. They bore the
tale like a garland. She read it again and again, with bewildered
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tapped it out herself on the keys of her Corona and
sent it to the editor of a very famous magazine, with the
signature of “V. Lydiat.” As I have said, that matter took
long thought, prompted from behind by instincts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was done and V. Lydiat, a climbing star, shed a faint
beam over the world. For the editor wrote back eagerly.
He knew he had found a new flavour. “Your work impresses
me as extremely original. I am anxious to see more
of it. I need hardly say I accept it for the magazine and I
shall hope to hear from you again before long.” A cheque
followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No need to dwell on Beatrice Veronica’s feelings, mixed
beyond disentanglement. She was not astonished that the
work should be recognized as good, but—V. Lydiat! What
had happened to her and how? Strange tales are told to-day
of sudden brain-stimulations and complexes. Was she
the happy victim of such an adventure, and if so, would it
be recurrent? How should she know? What should she
do? She felt herself moving in worlds not realized, and
could not in the least decide the simple question of whether
it was honest to accept commendation for a thing she felt in
her very soul she had not done and could not do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then, who? What was V. Lydiat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, she, or it, came from starrier spheres than hers.
Wings plumed its shoulders, while hers were merely becomingly
draped in seasonable materials. She knew that the
visitor was a subtler spirit, dwelling beyond the mysteries,
saturated with the colour and desire of dead ages which can
never die—an authentic voice, hailed at once by the few, to
be blown at last on the winds of the soul which, wandering
the world, let fall here and there the seeds of amaranth and
asphodel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes—V. Lydiat was entirely beyond her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But you will understand that, though Beatrice Veronica
could not enter into the secret places, it was a most wonderful
thing to be amanuensis and business manager. To her
fell the letters from editors and publishers, the correspondence
which rained in from the ends of the earth, protesting
gratitude, praise, entreaties for counsel in all things from
routes to religions. These latter were the most difficult,
for it would have taken V. Lydiat to answer them adequately.
But Beatrice Veronica did the best she could, and
her life moved onward aureoled and haloed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She learned at last the rules of the game. V. Lydiat’s
ethereal approach could only be secured by the wand of a
fountain pen. She must sit thus armed with a fair sheet
before her and wait, fixing her mind on some idle point of
light or persistent trembling of leaves, and suddenly the
world would pass miraculously from her and she would
awake in another—an amazing world, most beautiful, brimming
with romance, lit by suns of gallant men and moons of
loveliest women. The great jewels of the Orient shed
starry splendours, and ghostly creeping figures pursued them
through jungles and mountain passes. Strange magics
lurked in the dark and drew the soul along the Way of
Wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strangest experience. It began always in the same
way. The blue Canadian sky, the hyacinth gleam of the sea
through oak and pine dissolved in unrealities of mist, and
sultry Oriental skies, yellow as a lion’s eyes or the brazen
boom of a gong, beat their fierce sunlight downward as from
an inverted bowl. And then—then, she knew V. Lydiat
was at hand. But never with companionship. It was a
despot and entered in, with flags flying, to the annihilation of
Beatrice Veronica. She wrote like a thing driven on a wind,
and woke to find it done. The possession obliterated her,
and when she could collect her routed forces it was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So time went on and V. Lydiat’s fame was established and
Beatrice Veronica wore it as a woman too poor to appear at
Court with fitting magnificence shines in borrowed jewels
and trembles to wear them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night in the moonlit warmth, with the vast Princesses
of the Dark hidden in the ambush of breathless trees, she sat
in the high veranda of her little house with the broad vista
through pines to the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a heavenly night; if the baby waves broke in the
little bay they must break in diamonds,—the wet stones
must shine like crystals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day V. Lydiat had transported her to a great and
silent jungle in Cambodia and they went up together through
the crowding whispering trees to the ruined palaces where
once great kings dwelt, and passed together through sounding
halls sculptured with dead myths to the chambers, once
secret, whence queens looked forth languidly from wildly-carved
casements into the wilderness of sweets in the
gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>V. Lydiat had led her to a great tank of crystal water in
the knotted shade, paved with strange stones inlaid with
human figures in wrought metal,—a place where women
with gold-embraced heads once idly bathed their slender
limbs in the warm lymph—a secret place then, but now open
to cruel sunlight and cold incurious stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far she knew it all. She had photographed that tank
with its stony cobras while Sidney Verrier timed the exposure.
But of the story told to-day she knew nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wonderful story, old as time, new as to-morrow, for the
figures in it were of to-day, people who had gone there, as
she herself had done, only to see, and were captured, subjugated
by the old alarming magic which lurks in the jungle
and behind the carven walls and eyeless windows. A dangerous
place, and she had not known it then—had thought
of it only as a sight to be seen, a memory to be treasured.
But V. Lydiat knew better—knew it was alive and terrible
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned her arms on the sill and looked out to the sea
that led towards the hidden Orient and in her heart she
spoke to the strange visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew you,” she whispered. “You come and go
and I can’t touch you even while you are within and about
me. You interpret. You make life wonderful, but perhaps
you are more wonderful still. If I could only lay hold of
you, touch you, have one glimpse of you! <span class='it'>What</span> are you?
Where do you come from? Where do you go? I hear. O,
let me see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like a prayer, and the more intense because the
dead stillness of the night presented it as its own cry and
entreaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dead silence. Not even the voice of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her head on her folded arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been obedient. I’ve laid myself down on the
threshold that you might walk over me and take possession.
Have you no reward for me? Are you just some strange
cell of my own brain suddenly awake and working, or are
you some other—what?—but nearer to me than breathing,
as near as my own soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The longing grew inarticulate and stronger, like the dumb
yearning instincts which move the world of unspeaking
creatures. It seemed to her that she sent her soul through
the night pleading, pleading. Then very slowly she relaxed
into sleep as she lay in the moonlight—deep, soul-satisfying
sleep. And so dreamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood in the Shalimar Garden of the dead Mogul Empresses
in Kashmir. How well she knew it, how passionately
she loved it! She and Sidney Verrier had moored
their houseboat on the Dal Lake not far away one happy
summer and had wandered almost daily to the Shalimar,
glorying in the beauty of its fountains and rushing cascades,
and the roses—roses everywhere in a most bewildering
sweetness. How often she had gone up the long garden
ways to the foot of the hills that rise into mountains and
catch the snows and stars upon their heights. It was no
wonder she should dream of it. So in her dream she walked
up to the great pavilion supported on noble pillars of black
marble from Pampoor, and the moon swam in a wavering
circle in the water before it, and she held back a moment
to see it break into a thousand reflections, and then became
aware of a man leaning with folded arms by the steps: his
face clear in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly she knew him, as he did her—the man of her
dream of the Temple of Govindhar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As before he turned and came toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have waited for you by the temple and here and in
many other places. I wait every night. How is it you come
so seldom?” he said. His voice was stronger, his bearing
more alert and eager than at Govindhar. He spoke with a
kind of assurance of welcome which she responded to instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have come. I didn’t know. How can I tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only one way. Why didn’t you learn it in India?
It was all round you and you didn’t even notice.
You don’t know your powers. Listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beatrice Veronica drew towards him, eyes rapt on his
face, scarcely breathing. Yes—in India she had felt there
were mighty stirrings about her, thrills of an unknown
spiritual life, crisping the surface like a breeze, and passing—passing
before ever you could say it was there. But it
did not touch her with so much as an outermost ripple. She
was too ignorant. Now—she could learn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see—this is the way of it,” he said, leaning against
the black pillar. “The soul is sheer thought and knowledge,
but, prisoned in the body, it is the slave of the senses
and all its powers are limited by these. And they lead it
into acts which in their consequences are fetters of iron.
Still, at a certain point of attainment one can be freer than
most men believe possible. When this is so, you use the
Eight Means of Mental Concentration and are free. You
step into a new dimension.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this true? Do you know it?” she said earnestly.
“Because, if there is any way which can be taken, I have a
quest—something—someone——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stammered, and could not finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. Someone you want to find in the dark. Well,
it can be done. You would not believe the possibilities of
that freed state of consciousness. Here, in the Shalimar
you think you see nothing but moonlight and water—nothing
in fact but what your senses tell you. But that is nonsense.
Your eyes are shut. You are asleep in Canada and
yet you see them by the inner light of memory even now
and the help I am giving you! Well—use the Eight Means,
and you will see them waking and as clearly as you do in
sleep. But I, who am instructed, see more. This garden
to me is peopled with those who made it—the dead kings and
queens who rejoiced in its beauty. See—” he laid his hand
on hers and suddenly she saw. Amazing—amazing! They
were alone no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting on the floor of the pavilion, looking down into the
moon-mirroring water was a woman in the ancient dress of
Persia, golden and jewelled,—she flung her head up magnificently
as if at the words, and looked at them, the moon
full in her eyes. The garden was peopled now not only with
roses but white blossoms sending out fierce hot shafts of
perfume. They struck Beatrice Veronica like something
tangible, and half dazed her as she stared at the startling
beauty of the unveiled woman revealed like a flaming jewel
in the black and white glory of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his hand on hers, she knew without words. Nourmahal
the Empress, ruler of the Emperor who made the
Shalimar for her pleasure, who put India with all its glories
at her feet. Who else should be the soul of the garden?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Beatrice Veronica that she had never beheld
beauty before. It was beyond all pictures, all images in its
sultry passionate loveliness,—it was——</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as she watched spellbound, the man lifted his hand
from hers and the garden was empty of all but moonlight
and roses once more, and he and she alone. She could have
wept for utter loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it a ghost?” she asked trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,—an essential something that remains in certain
places, not a ghost. There is nothing of what you mean by
that word. Don’t be frightened! You’ll often see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him perplexed, and he added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see? One has only to put oneself in the receptive
state and time is no more. One sees—one hears. You
are only a beginner so I cannot show you much. But you
<span class='it'>are</span> a beginner or you would not be here in the Shalimar with
me now. There is a bond between us which goes back—”
He paused, looking keenly at her, and said quickly “Centuries,
and further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was stunned, dazed by the revelations. They meant
so much more that it is possible to record. Also the sensation
was beginning in her which we all know before waking.
The dream wavers on its foundation, loosens, becomes misty,
makes ready to disappear. It would be gone—gone before
she could know. She caught his hand as if to steady it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you V. Lydiat?” she cried.—“You must be. You
are. You come to me every day—a voice. O let me come
to you like this, and teach me, teach me, that I may know
and see. I am a blind creature in a universe of wonders.
Let me come every night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was receding, palpitating, collapsing, but his
voice came as if from something beyond it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what you call me. Names are nothing. Yes,
come every night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gone. She was in the Shalimar alone, and somewhere
in the distance she heard Sidney Verrier’s voice calling
clear as a bird. Beatrice Veronica woke that morning
with the sun glorying through the eastern arch of her veranda.
She was still dressed. She had slept there all night.
Of the dream she remembered snatches, hints, which left
new hopes and impulses germinating in her soul. The unknown
flowers were sown in spring. They would blossom
in summer in unimaginable beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the beginning of a time of strange and enchanting
happiness. Thus one may imagine the joy of a man
born blind who by some miraculous means is made to see,
and wakes in a world of wonders. It is impossible that anyone
should know greater bliss. The very weight of it made
her methodical and practical lest a grain of heavenly gold
should escape her in its transmutation to earthly terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning was V. Lydiat’s. At ten o’clock she betook
herself to her high veranda, and folding her hands and composing
her mind looked out to sea through the wide way of
pines which terminated in its azure beauty. Then, as has
been told before, it would blow softly away on a dream-wind,
and the story begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at night there was now invariably the meeting. At
first that was always in some place she knew—somewhere
she recognized from memory, haunts of her own with Sidney
Verrier. But one night a new thing happened—she woke
into dream by the Ganges at Cawnpore, at the terrible Massacre
Ghaut, a place she had always avoided because of the
horrible memories of the Indian mutiny which sicken the
soul of every European who stands there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she stood at the top of the beautiful broken steps
under the dense shade of the very trees where the mutineers
ambushed, and he was below, beckoning her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done, well done!” he said, as she came slowly down
to where holy Ganges lips the lowest step. “This was a
great experiment. You could never have come here alone,—I
could not have brought you until now, and I had to fight
the repugnance in you, but here you are. You see? We
have been putting stepping-stones, you and I, each from our
own side, and now the bridge is made and we hold hands
in the middle. You can come anywhere now. And listen—I
too am learning to go where I have never been. The
world will be open to us soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her with glowing eyes—the eyes of the explorer,
the discoverer, on the edge of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why here—in this horrible place?” She shrank a
little even from him as she looked about her. He laughed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is no more now than a last year’s winter storm.
They know. They were not afraid even then. They laugh
now as they go on their way. Be happy, beloved. They
are beyond the mysteries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of that dream, she carried back to earth the word “beloved.”
Who had said it, she could not tell, but in the dark—the
warm friendly dark—there was someone who loved
her, whom she loved with a perfect union. Was it—could
it be V. Lydiat? She did not know. Also she remembered
that she had dreamed the Massacre Ghaut at Cawnpore, and
took pains to search for pictures and stories of the place
to verify her dream. Yes—it was true. Things were becoming
clearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, her power in writing increased very noticeably about
this time. V. Lydiat was recognized as holding a unique
place amongst writers of the Orient. On the one side were
the scholars, the learned men who wrote in terms of ancient
Oriental thought, terms no ordinary reader could understand,
and on the other, the writers of the many-faceted
surface, the adventurers, toying with the titillating life of
zenana and veiled dangerous love-affairs,—a tissue of
coloured crime. V. Lydiat recorded all, and with a method
of his own which approached perfect loveliness in word and
phrase. The faiths of the East were his,—in India and
China alike his soul sheltered under the Divine Wings, at
home in strange heavens, and hells which one day would
blossom into heavens. As he and Beatrice Veronica had
posed stepping-stones until they met in the middle, so he
built a splendid bridge across the wide seas of misunderstanding
between east and west, and many souls passed
across it going and coming and were glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only a pioneer,” he said to Beatrice Veronica one
day (she could dream the day as well as the night) sitting
in the gardens of the Taj. “You too. It will be done much
better soon. See how we are out-growing our limitations
and feeling out after the wonders of the sub-conscious
self, the essential that hands on the torch when we die.
Die? No, I hate that word. Let’s say, climb a step higher
on the ladder of existence. Every inch gives us a wider
view of the country. You see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She liked that “You see?” which came so often. It was
so eager—so fraternal in a way. Yes, they were good comrades,
she and V. Lydiat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know I write for you?” she ventured to ask.
“I have often wondered if you speak as unconsciously as I
write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no. I know. I always know. Longer ago than
you would believe you used to work for me. We are in the
same whirl-pool, you and I. Our atoms must always be
whirled together again. You can’t escape me, Beatrice
Veronica.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I want to?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in daily life she clung to her secret like grim death.
She would not have been burdened with V. Lydiat’s laurels
for the world. The dishonesty of it! And yet one could
never explain. Hopeless! Who would believe? And
apart from that, she had a kind of growing certainty that
V. Lydiat would enter upon his own one day. Not that she
remembered him as any more than a vague dream influence;
she did not, but yet the realization of a Presence was growing,
and she herself developing daily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is not much space here to tell the wondrous sights
she saw with V. Lydiat, and holding by his hand. That
would be a book in itself—and a beautiful one. And
though she could only remember them in drifts like a waft
of far-off music on a breeze, it was incomparable food for
the sub-conscious self, and strengthened every latent faculty
of memory and experience. Beatrice Veronica promised
to be a very remarkable woman if some day the inner
and outer faculties should unite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what was to be the solvent? That, this story can
only indicate faintly for the end is not yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went out a little less into her small world of daily life—not
shunning it certainly, but her inner life was so
crowded, so blissful that the outer seemed insipid enough.
Why figure at teas and bridge parties, and struggle with the
boredom of mah jong when the veranda was waiting with the
green way before it that led to the silence of the sea, and
the lover beyond? For it had come to that—the lover. All
joy summed up in that word, joy unmeasurable as the oceans
of sunlight—a perfect union. She walked as one carefully
bearing a brimmed cup,—not a drop, not a drop must spill,—so
she carried herself a little stiffly as it might seem to the
outer world which could not guess the reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People liked her—but she moved on her own orbit, and it
only intersected theirs at certain well-defined points. Her
soft abstracted air won but eluded;—it put an atmosphere
of strangeness about her, of thoughts she could not share
with anyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She must have rather a lonely life of it!” they said.
But she never had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day came a letter from Sidney Verrier, now Sidney
Mourilyan, from her husband’s coffee plantation in the
Shevaroy Hills in southern India. She wrote from the settlement
of Yercaud— “Not a town,” she wrote, “but dear
little scattered houses in the trees. We have even a club,
think of it!—after the wilds where you and I have been!—and
there are pleasant people, and Tony expects to do well
with coffee here. I wish half the day that you could come.
You would like it, B. V.— You would like it! And you
would like my boy—two years old now, and a sheer delight.
Not to mention my garden. The growth here! The heliotropes
are almost trees. The jasmines have giant stars.
The house is stormed with flowers—almost too sweet.
Couldn’t you come? Don’t you hear the east calling? At
all events you hear me calling, for I want you. And you
must be having very idle lazy days, for I remember I never
could imagine what you would find to do if you stopped
travelling. Your whole soul was in that. It’s a cold country
you’re in—frigid pines, and stark mountains and icy
seas. Do come out into the sunshine again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid down the letter there and looked at the beloved
pines almost glittering in the sunshine as it slid off their
smooth needles. And idle?—her life, her wonderful secret
life! Little indeed did Sidney know if she could write like
that. She took up the letter again, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And listen, B. V.—there’s a man going round by Japan
to Canada, a man called Martin Welland. I should like you
to know him for two reasons. First, he can tell you all
about this place. Second, I think he is interesting. If you
don’t find him so, shunt him. My love, my dear B. V., and
do come. Think of all you might do with this as a starting
point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was more, but that is the essential. You may
think at this point that you know exactly how this story
must inevitably end. But no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about four months after this that Beatrice Veronica
was rung up on the telephone in her veranda as she sat
reading. The imperative interruption annoyed her;—she
put down her book. A man’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Leslie? I think your friend Mrs. Mourilyan told
you I was coming to Victoria. My name is Welland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polite assurances from the veranda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am staying at the Empress. May I come out and
see you this afternoon? I have a small parcel for you from
Mrs. Mourilyan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was settled, and with her Chinese servant she made
the little black oak table beautiful with silver and long-stemmed
flowers in beautiful old English glass bowls. If
he went back to Yercaud he should at least tell Sidney that
her home in “that cold country” was desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came at four and she could hear his voice in the little
hall as Wing admitted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She liked it. The words were clear, well-cut, neither
blurred nor bungled. Then he came in. A tall man, broad-shouldered,
with grey eyes and hair that sprang strongly
from a broad forehead, clean-shaven, a sensitive mouth, possibly
thirty-eight, or so. All these things flashed together
in an impression of something to be liked and trusted. On
his side he saw a young woman in a blue-grey gown with
hazel eyes and hair to match—a harmony of delicate browns
enhancing an almond-pale face with faintly coloured lips
and a look of fragility which belied the nervous strength beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parcel was given and received; a chain of Indian
moonstones in silver, very lovely in its shifting lights, and
then came news, much news, of the home at Yercaud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard of you so much there that you are no stranger
to me,” he said, watching with curious interest while she
filled the Chinese cups of pink and jade porcelain with jasmine
tea from a hidden valley in Anhui. It fascinated him—the
white hands flitting like little quick birds on their
quick errands, the girl, so calm and self-possessed, mistress
of herself and her house. Many years of wandering had
opened his heart to the feminine charm of it all, the quiet,
the rose-leaf scent in the air, the things which group by instinct
about a refined woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a delightful home!” he said at last, rather
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes— When you return do try to convince Mrs.
Mourilyan that I don’t live in a hut on an iceberg. You
agree with me, I am sure, that only Kashmir and perhaps
one or two other places can be more beautiful than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I fully agree. Yet it misses something which
permeates India in places far less beautiful. It lacks atmosphere.
Just as the fallen leaves of a forest make up a
rich soil in which all growth is luxuriant, so the dead ancientry
of India makes earth and air rich with memory and
tradition—and more. You can’t get it in these new countries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” she said eagerly. “Here it’s just a beautiful
child with all her complexities before her. It rests one,
you know. I felt it an amazing rest when I came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can understand that. And they tell me the climate
is delightful. I wish I could stay here. I may come back
some day. But I must return to India in four months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes and no. I have collected an immense quantity of
notes for several books, but—now you will laugh!—I shall
never write them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why—why? I know there’s an immense opening
for true books about the Orient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so too. But you allow it’s a drawback that I
am entirely devoid of the writing gift. I have my knowledge.
I have the thing flame-clear in my mind. But let
me put it on paper and it evaporates. Dull as ditchwater!
You see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That last little phrase sent a blush flying up her cheek.
It recalled many things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I see. But couldn’t you put it in skilful hands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid down his cup and turned suddenly on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could <span class='it'>you</span> do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? I wish I could, but I am doing work at present——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Literary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of a sort. Secretarial. I write from dictation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask what sort of things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a curious reluctance she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indian,” and said no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed to meditate a moment on that; then said
slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears you have experience of the very things that
interest me. Tell me—for I have been so long in the
wilds— Is there any writer nowadays taking the place
with regard to things Indian that Lafcadio Hearn did with
things Japanese? A man who gets at the soul of it as well
as the beautiful surface?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With her eyes on the ground and a sense of something
startling in the air, she answered with a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever heard of V. Lydiat’s books?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a puzzled furrow between his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I know of. Up in Kulu and beyond, the new
books don’t penetrate. A man or a woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People are not certain. The initial might mean either.
But the critics all say a man. The last is called the ‘The
Unstruck Music,’ the one before ‘The Dream of Stars.’
The first, ‘The Ninefold Flower.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful names,” he said. “Can I get them here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can lend them to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked long after that, in a curiously intimate way
that gave her secret but intense happiness. It was almost
in fear that she asked when he was going on and where.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he went off he carried the three books under his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall read ‘The Ninefold Flower,’ first. It interests
me to see how a writer’s mind develops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night she had no dream and next day she tried even
more eagerly than usual to get in touch with V. Lydiat,
but in vain. The oracle was dumb. It frightened her, for
the whole thing was so strange that she had never felt sure
it might not vanish as suddenly as it came. She sat patiently
all that morning, hoping and sorely disturbed, but the
Pacific hung a relentless azure curtain before her fairyland
and the pines dreamed their own sunshine-fragrance and
made no way for palms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one o’clock the telephone rang sharply,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welland speaking. May I come and see you this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible for she had an engagement, but she
named the evening at eight. He caught at it—his voice was
evidence of that eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came a minute or two before the time, and a book was
in his hand. She knew the cover with a drift of stars across
it before he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It broke out the moment he was in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most amazing thing. I hardly know how to tell you.
You’ll think I’m mad. It’s my book—<span class='it'>mine</span>, yet I never
wrote it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stared at each other in a kind of consternation and
the little colour in her face fell away and left her lily-pale.
She could feel but not control the trembling of her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean—there are my notes one after another, but
expressed in a way I never could hope for, exquisitely expressed.
But it’s mine all the same. A cruel, enchanting
robbery! You don’t believe me. How could you? But
I can prove it. See here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With passionate haste he pulled a roll of paper from his
pocket, and pushed the typed sheets before her. The first
story in “The Ninefold Flower,” was called “The Lady of
Beauty.” The notes began, “The Queen of Beauty,” and
went on <span class='it'>seriatim</span> with the scaffolding of the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way it’s done here, in this book, is the very way I
used to see it in my dreams, but it was utterly beyond me.
For God’s sake, tell me what you think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s yours. No doubt of that. But his too.
You blocked out the marble. He made the statue. The
very judgment of Solomon could not decide between you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” he said hopelessly. “But the mystery of
it. The appalling hopeless mystery. No eye but mine has
ever seen that paper till now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence. A grey moth flew in from the garden and circled
about the lamp. The little flutter of its wings was the
only sound. Then in a shaken voice very unlike its usual
sedate sweetness, she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Welland, do you ever dream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awake? Constantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw caution steal into his frank eyes and drop a
curtain before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you ask? Everyone dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gathered up all her courage for the next question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you ever in the Shalimar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. Does anyone ever go to Kashmir and miss
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was fencing, that was palpable. It gave her hope for
a golden gleam through her fear. She clasped her shaking
hands tightly in each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the strangest dreams. I can only bring back
snatches. Yet I know there is a wonderful connected story
behind them. I dreamt the Shalimar not long ago,—I
brought back one image. A woman in an old Persian dress
sitting by the black Pampoor pillars and looking down into
the water where the moon dipped and swam all gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, go on!” he breathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were flowers—white flowers. I never saw them
there in the daylight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unbearably sweet,” he interjected. “The scent is like
the thrust of a lance. I know, I know. But there was another
woman. I can’t remember her face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did she stand?” asked Beatrice Veronica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Near me—but she could see nothing. The day still
blinded her, until——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until you laid your hand on hers. Then she saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another long silence. Only the beating of the moth’s
wings. He leaned forward from his chair and laid his hands
on the clasp of hers. Their eyes met, absorbing each other;
the way for the electric current was clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember now,” he said, very softly. “It was you.
It was you at the Temple of Govindhar. At the Massacre
Ghaut of Cawnpore. Ah, I dragged you there against your
will to show I was the stronger. It is you—always you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was she to say? With his hands on hers it was a
union of strength which put the past before both like an
open book. She remembered all the dreams now. Impossible
to tell them here—they were so many, like and unlike,
shaken shifting jewels in a kaleidoscope held in some unseen
hand. But jewels. They sat a long time in this way, rapt
in wordless memories, their eyes absorbing each other—the
strangest reunion. When speech came it brought rapture
which needed little explanation. They bathed in wonder as
in clear water, they flung the sparkle of it over their heads
and glittered to each other in its radiance. When had such
a miracle been wrought for any two people in all the world?
The dreams of the visionary were actual for them and
heaven and earth instinct with miracle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we are married—when we pass our lives utterly
together the bond will be stronger,” he said, kissing her hand
passionately two hours later. “We shall be awake with reason
and intellect as well as vision to help our work, we shall
do such things as the world has never dreamed, prove that
miracle is the daily bread of those who know. Two halves
of a perfect whole made one forever and ever. You see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her a moment with shining eyes and added,
“The wise will come to us for wisdom, the poets for beauty,
and we shall make our meeting-places the shrines of a new
worship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beatrice Veronica agreed with every pulse of her blood.
The Great Adventure, and together!—what bliss could equal
that marvel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were together perpetually, and surely human happiness
was never greater than that of these two adventurers
with the blue capes of Wonderland in sight at last over
leagues of perilous seas. In another image, their caravan
halted outside the gates of Paradise, and in a short few
weeks those gates would swing open for them and, closing,
shut out Fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not dream of Martin Welland now, nor he
of her. The discovery and all it involved was so thrilling
that it brought every emotion to the surface as blood flushes
the face when the heart beats violently. The inner centres
were depleted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were married and Paradise was at hand, but for a
while the happy business of settling their life engrossed
them. It would be better to live in Canada and make long
delightful visits to the Orient to refill the cisterns of marvel,
they thought. A room for mutual work must be plotted in
the bungalow; then there was the anxious question of a
southern aspect. Then it was built, and it became a debatable
decision whether some of the pines must fall to enlarge
the vista to the sea. Friends rallied about her on the news
of the marriage, and rejoiced to see the irradiation of Beatrice
Veronica’s pale face. Then they must be entertained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the endless joyful discussions as to whether the author
should still be V. Lydiat or whether collaboration
should be admitted. These things and many more filled the
happy world they dwelt in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can the end be foreseen? They never foresaw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hungry claim of human bliss fixed its roots in the
inner soil where the Rosa Mystica had blossomed, and exhausted
it for all else. That, at least, is the way in which
one endeavours to state the mysterious enervation of the sub-conscious
self which had built the stepping-stones between
them to the meeting-point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went hopefully to her table when they had settled
down, and he sat beside her doing his utmost to force the
impulse across inches which had made nothing of oceans.
It was dead. He could think of nothing but the sweet mist
of brown tendrils in the nape of her neck, the pure line from
ear to chin, the delights of the day to be. She sat with the
poor remnant of his notes before her—for nearly all had
been exhausted in the three books—and tried to shape them
into V. Lydiat’s clear and sensitive beauty of words. It
could not be done. Her eight thousand words marched and
deployed heavy-footed as before. They were as unmanageable
as mutineers or idiots. There was no life in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it all descended to calmer levels. They slept in each
other’s arms, but they never dreamed of each other now.
They had really been nearer in their ghostly meeting by the
Taj Mahal or in the evil splendours of Govindhar—far
nearer, when she wrote and could not cease for joy, than
when Martin Welland sat beside her and struggled to find
what had flashed like light in the old days. They had to
face it at last—V. Lydiat was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It troubled them much for a while, but troubled the world
more. The publishers were besieged with questions and
entreaties. Finally those also slackened and died off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>V. Lydiat was buried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They thought that perhaps if they returned to India the
dead fire would re-kindle under that ardent sun. But no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, at Benares, standing near the great Monkey
Temple of Durga, Martin stopped suddenly, and a light
came into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“B. V. I’ve just remembered that one of the wisest of
the pandits lives near here—a wonderful old fellow called
Jadrup Gosein. Let’s go and state the case to him. The
wisest man I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went, Beatrice Veronica ashamed to feel a little uprush
of regret at the sacrifice of a part of the wonderful day.
Martin knew so much. It was heavenly to go to these
places with him, and have them illumined by his research.
But they went to the pandit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The holy man was seated under the shadow of a great
image of Ganesha the Elephant-Headed One, the Giver of
Counsel, and when they sat themselves before him at a measured
distance the case was stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long pause—a deep silence filled with hot
sunshine smelling of marigolds, and the patter of bare feet
on sun-baked floors, as curious quick eyes watched the conclave
from afar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jadrup Gosein meditated deeply, then raised his serene
dark face upon them with the dim look that peers from the
very recesses of being. His words, incomprehensible to Beatrice
Veronica, had the hollow resonance of a bell, near at
hand but softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a man long since,” he began, “to whom the
high Gods offered in reward of merit, a rose-tree—very small
and weak,—a suckling, as it were, among trees, with feeble
fibrous root, accessible to all the dangers of drought and
sun, and as he stretched his hand doubting, they offered him
for choice a rose from the trees of Paradise, crimson and
perfumed, its hidden bosom pearled with dew and wafting
divine odours. And they said ‘Choose.’ So he said within
his soul, ‘The tree may die—who knows the management
of its frail roots? But the rose is here, sweeter than sweet,
immortal since it grew in Paradise! I choose the rose.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they put it in his hand. And the wise Elephant-Headed
One said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘O fool! What is a rose compared to a rose-tree that
bears myriads of roses? Also the rose dies in the heat of
human hands. The tree lives; a gathered rose is dead.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My children, you have chosen the rose. Be content.
Yet in another life remember and cling to that which unsevered
from the parent tree sends roots into the Now, the
Then, and the Future, and blossoms immortally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he dismissed them kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He means,” said Martin with troubled brow, “that ordinary
household happiness shuts a man in from the stars.
Do you remember the flute of Pan, B. V.? He tore the
reed from the river and massacred it as a reed to make it a
music-bearer for the Gods.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The true Gods sigh for the cost and pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>For the reed that grows never more again</p>
<p class='line0'>As a reed with the reeds in the river.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“But we are so happy!” she whispered, clinging against
him to feel the warmth of his love. “The outer spaces are
cold, cold. I don’t regret V. Lydiat. I have you. The
reeds were happier in the river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Welland sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had both,” he said. “You have only me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that regret also slipped away. They forgot. It all
faded into the light of common day and they were extremely
happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two could never account for the way in which they
had come together in that dream-land of theirs. They had
lost the clue of the mystery once and for all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jadrup Gosein could have told them, but it never occurred
to them to ask him. There are however many lives and the
Gods have a long patience.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>THE SEA OF LILIES<br/> <br/> <span style='font-size:smaller'>A STORY OF CHINA</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I had come down from the mountain fastnesses of my
home in Kashmir on pilgrimage to a certain island off the
coast of China. A long, long pilgrimage, but necessary; for,
with a Buddhist monk attached to the monastery of Kan-lu-ssu
in the hills of North China, I was to collect certain information
from the libraries and scholars of two famous
monasteries on the island of Puto. I, Lancelot Dunbar, am
known to the monks of the northern monastery of Kan-lu-ssu
by the friendly title of “Brother of the Pen,” and it is my
delightful lot to labour abundantly among the strange and
wonderful stores of ancient Buddhist and historic knowledge
contained in some of the many monastic libraries scattered
up and down India, China and Ceylon. It follows that my
wife and I own two homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One is a little deserted monastery in the Western Hills, in
China, known as “First Gate of Heaven,” and so beautiful
that the name might have grown about it like the moss on
its tiled roofs. Following the bigger monasteries, it has its
quiet courtyard, its lotus-pool and the peaked roofs with
their outward, upturned sweep. The pines crowd upon us,
and the cloud-dragons of rain and wind play in their uncouth
sport among the peaks and fill our streams with singing,
glittering water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our other home is a red-pine hut near the Liderwat in
Kashmir. The beauty of it, the warm homeliness set amid
the cold magnificence of the hills and immeasurable forests,
no tongue can tell. The hut is very large and low, divided
into our own rooms and the guest-rooms, with hospitable
fireplaces for fragrant pine-logs and floors strewn with rugs
brought by yak and pony down the wild tracks from Yarkand
and Leh. Beautiful rooms, as I think—the windows
looking out into the pines and the endless ways that lead to
romance and vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which home is the more beautiful I cannot say. We have
never known, and our friends give no help; for some choose
one and some the other. One day I shall write of our life in
Kashmir, the clean, beautiful enchantment of it, the journeyings
into the mountains—but to-day I must recall myself
to the pilgrimage to Puto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an island off the coast of China, as I said before, most
holy to the Buddhists of the Far East, dear to all who know
it in its beauty and religious peace and the lovely legends
that cling about it, a place of purification of the heart and
of a serenity that the true pilgrim may hope to carry away
with him as the crowning of his toil and prayer. It is one
of the Chusan Archipelago and is separated from the large
island of Chusan by a stretch of water known as the “Sea of
Lilies.” And it is not very far distant from the hybrid dissipations
of Shanghai and the swarming streets of Ningpo
and can be reached from either. Yet it is as far removed
from their hard realities as if it were built on floating clouds
and lit by other dawns than ours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shanghai concerns itself, I am told, with that ancient and
universally respected Trinity of the World, the Flesh, and
the Devil. I know little of it myself and accept the testimony
of friends, and especially of one who knew it well.
“I just think,” he said with conviction, “that if nothing happens
to Shanghai, Sodom and Gomorrah were very unfairly
dealt with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I met my friend Shan Tao in Ningpo, and we set sail
together. The island of Puto, at all events, concerns itself
with a very different Trinity from that of Shanghai. For
the deity of Puto is the Supreme, enthroned in eternal light,
and on his right hand stands Wisdom and on his left, Love.
The patron saint of this island is Kwan-yin (the Kwannon
of Japan), the incarnation of divine love and pity, she who
has refused to enter paradise, so that, remaining on this
sad earth, she may be attentive to the tears and prayers of
humanity and depart from it only when the Starry Gates
have closed behind the last sinner and sorrow and sighing
have fled away like clouds melting into the golden calms of
sunset. Yet when I say “she,” I limit the power of this
mighty <span class='it'>Bodhisattva</span>, or <span class='it'>Pusa</span>, as Buddhas-to-be are called
in India and China. For that pure essence is far above all
limitations of sex and, uniting in itself the perfection of both,
may be manifested as either, according to need and opportunity.
Be that as it may, Puto is the holiest, most immediate
home of Kwan-yin, and her influence spreads far beyond its
shores and makes the very sea that surrounds it sacred.
Therefore it is to this day the Sea of Lilies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For when the Dwarf-men, the Japanese, came storming
down on the island from Hangchow long ago and carried
off a part of the sacred relics, they woke in the dawn to
find their ship moving slower and slower and finally rocking
like a ship asleep in what seemed a vast meadow of lilies.
Thick as snow about them lay the ivory chalices with golden
stamens; thick as the coiling of snakes innumerable were
the long piped and knotted stems, with the great prone
leaves. Neither oar nor sail could move the ship; for the
mysterious lilies, white and silent, that had sprung up from
the depths in a night held it as if with chains. And then
comprehension entered the hearts of the Dwarfs, and, taking
hurried counsel, they put the ship about and headed for
the sacred island once more. As they did so, a soft wind
like the waft of a passing garment breathed on the surface
of the sea, the ivory chalices closed and the crystal lymph
flowed over them, and, where the leagues of blossom had
spread, were now only the foam-flowers of the waste ocean.
So the treasures were restored to Puto, and, when the story
was told to the monks, they adored the Heavenly Lady who
guards her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lest it be said that the burdened consciences of the
Dwarfs misled them into a dream, let the story be told of
Wang Kuei, a haughty official who was sent on his Emperor’s
behalf to do reverence at the shrines of Puto and did it
grudgingly and with a pride that ill became him. So, when
his ship set sail from the island and he sat in glory on deck,
glad at heart that his service was over, suddenly her swift
course was stayed. Behold, in the moonlight, the meadows
of ocean had bloomed into innumerable lilies, and there was
no sea-track between them, no glimmer of water in the interstices
of the paving-leaves, and the ship was a prisoner of
beauty! Then the story of the Dwarfs rushed into his soul.
In haste he prostrated himself on the deck with his face toward
the island and prayed for pardon as he had never yet
prayed, and the Heavenly Lady heard him and the lilies
were resumed into her pure being. The man of pride returned
to Puto and, doing homage of the humblest, went
back in security to his Emperor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who can tell the beauty of Puto, looking forth on its
little sisters of the archipelago with the serenity of an elder
who has attained? We put up in one of the cells allotted
to pilgrims in a monastery among the hills overlooking the
Sea of Lilies. Surely, I think, a lovelier place could not be.
The little ways wind about the island, past great rocks sculptured
with holy figures and groves of trees that climb the
hills to the tiled roofs of the many temples and monasteries.
And wild and sweet on the hills grows the gardenia, whence
the island has its name of “White Flower.” The sunny
sweetness of its perfume recalled to me the far-away, wild
daphne bushes of Mount Abu in Rajputana, near the marvellous
white temples of Dilwara, temples of another, yet
not unallied, faith. It is easy to tell when the gods go by—it
can never be common air again, but sweet, sweet unutterably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day I trod the bays on sand fine as powdered gold or
wandered among the flowers, taking notes for my book at
the various temples and talking with the monks and such
hermits as are not under the vow of silence. When they
found I was at work for Kan-lu-ssu in the hills, they opened
their hearts and told me many things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suppose it is difficult for the western mind to comprehend
the impulses that send a man to dwell in the solitudes
of Puto, girdled with its miraculous sea, there to let the years
slip from him like a vesture, unheeded, unregretted—but to
me it is easy. Let me tell the story of one of these monks,
gathered from his own lips and told where a ravine breaks
down to the sands of a little bay; where the small waves fall
in a lulling monotone, a fitting burden to quiet words softly
spoken as the shadows lengthened to the hour of rest. He
was named in religion “High Illumination.” His name in
the world I cannot tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father had been a farmer in Anhui, a well-to-do man
for his class. There were two sons, and my friend was the
younger. His father, of whom he spoke with deep reverence,
had the utmost confidence in the elder brother. In dying,
he expressed only the desire that the elder brother would
make a just division with the younger of all the possessions
he was leaving, and so departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was content,” said High Illumination, “knowing
my father’s wisdom and believing that his wish, uttered in
the presence of us both, would be as binding upon my honoured
brother as an imperial command. Therefore, when all
observances of departure had been completed and the proper
time came, I expected my share in peace, and the more so
since my good father had provided for my marriage with
a beautiful maiden, the daughter of a lifelong friend. But
that was not to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And still my brother said nothing; all the duties of the
seasons proceeded and I worked and helped him, expecting
daily that he would speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then at last in great astonishment I ventured this:
‘Honoured Elder Brother, the will of our just father is still
unfulfilled. Should we not proceed in this matter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he, with anger and a reddened face: ‘What is this
discontent? Do you not share the land where you labour
upon it? What more would you have?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, very temperately and courteously, I said: ‘Honoured
Elder Brother, I work but as a hired man who has no hire.
I have not so much as a <span class='it'>cash</span> in my pocket to buy me the
least of pleasures or needs. I have but my food, and that,
as I think, my elder sister [the brother’s wife] grudges me.
Such certainly was not the intention of our just father.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, his face distorted with rage, he replied, ‘Have your
way, and if it bring bitterness and disturbance of spirit, then
thank yourself for your greed!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>High Illumination paused a moment as if in memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Greed!” I said indignantly. “My friend, you were
wronged and cruelly. You could in a court of law have
compelled him to do you justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet he was right: for me it was greed,” said High Illumination,
with a smile of quiet humour. “I had thought
of it night and day, till it had soured my soul. But the next
day at dawn my brother called to me with anger in his voice
and said: ‘The division is now made. Come and see.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we passed along through the dewy dawn-gold in silence,
past his fields of budding rice and millet prosperously
green, and at last we came to a great stretch of pebbles and
water-springs where nothing would grow, no, not even a
blade of grass. The place had come to my father from
many ancestors, and none could either use or sell its barrenness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there it lay, grey and hard in the morning gold, and
my brother, pointing, said: ‘Take it; the division is made.
And when you store your plentiful rice, thank my generosity.’
And, turning, he left me and went back to his prosperity,
laughing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a devil’s deed,” I said. “Surely he laid up for
himself a black <span class='it'>karma</span> in so doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>High Illumination shook his head slowly. “Who can
judge the karma of another? Daily did I pray that my
brother’s feet might be set in the way of peace, and I had
assurance that thus and no otherwise it should be. But
hear the story and its loveliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I sat nearly all day, staring at the pebbles. There
was not even a yard of the ground that spade and hoe could
conquer, and I knew myself vanquished. Then in the evening
I rose and went to a neighbour and said, ‘I beseech you
to find me work; for I must eat or die.’ He gave me work
and the wage was my food only; for he was bone-poor. So
I lived for two years, and, if I passed my brother, he would
jeer at my rags and leanness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, as I went by my desolate heritage one day, I
saw that between the pebbles were pushing little bright
green shoots, strong and hardy, thrusting the small stones
aside to make room for their impatience. The tender
greenness pleased me. It was like warmth and sunshine to
see the life of it, and I wondered what manner of growth
could find food among the stones. For a while I could not
go that way, but, when I went again, behold a thing most
beautiful, for all the plants were covered with buds like
pearls!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother, hear a marvel. One day, before ever I came
in sight of it, a sweet perfume, warm with the sun, exhaling
the very breath of paradise, surrounded me. When I approached,
the desert had blossomed abundantly. I could
not see the stones; they were covered with lilies, white lilies,
each with a gold cup, set in ivory, to hold the incense-offering
to the sun. What could I say, what think in beholding this
miracle of loveliness? I sat beside them to watch what they
would do, and a light breeze moved the flowers like bells
upon the stems, and there was a going in the leaves of them
as though the hem of an unseen garment trailed among them.
And they were mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They had never grown there before?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man of those parts had seen the like; nor I myself.
Every day, when my work was done, I went to look at them
and sat to see their beauty of ivory and gold. And once, as
I sat, the rich official, Chung Ching-yu, rode by. Pausing
in astonishment, he bought a handful of the flowers, giving
me the first money I had seen for a year, and he told me to
gather the bulbs in due season and receive from him in return
their weight in silver. And what he said ran on to other
rich men and to men not rich, in the city of Ningpo, and they
came bidding against one another for the bulbs to sell to
the great and to send in ships to strange countries, until I
who had been poor scarce knew how to store my riches.
And I saw what my lilies loved and put for them more stones
and water, and the next year they were a wilderness of
sweets, where all the bees of the world came to gather
nectar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I knew indeed whence they came, since such beauty
could not be of earth, and I withdrew myself to a lonely
place and addressed my prayer to Kwan-yin, who had thus
blessed my poverty, and I said: ‘O Adorable, whose ears
are open ever to the cry of the oppressed, whose beautiful
eyes are pitiful to sorrow, I bless thee for this compassion.
And because I dread the love of riches, and the flowers and
not money, are to me my soul, give me grace so to receive
the mercy of thy gift that it may befit thy greatness and my
littleness.’ Even as I said the words, a thought came to me,
and I went to find my brother, whom I had not seen for
long days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, when he saw me come, his face darkened with rage,
and he said: ‘Are you come to taunt me because of my
folly, in that I gave the best of all the land to your idleness,
or to thank me for the gold it has heaped upon you? Speak
out; for the lucky man may speak.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, standing at the door, I said this: ‘Elder Brother,
your action was unjust, and certainly the Divine does not
sleep, but awaits its hour in peace. As for me, the Spirit of
Compassion has seen my poverty and had pity upon me, and
now I will tell you my heart. Two nights ago as I lay and
slept, it seemed to me that the moonlit air grew sweet with a
sweetness more than all my lilies—nay, than all the flowers
of earth—and I knew that the gates of paradise were opened
and that the immortal flowers exhaled their souls, and that
to breathe them was purification. Then, far off on a cloud
so white that it resembled the mystic petals of the lotus,
stood a lady with veiled face, and in one hand a chalice and
in the other a willow spray, and even through the veil her
beauty rayed as the moon behind a fleece of cloud. My
Brother, need I say her name?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, as I spoke, the hard face softened; for who is there
that knows not the Pity of the Lord? I continued: ‘In a
voice sweeter than sleep, she augustly addressed me, saying:
‘The Divine on its hidden throne knows no repose while the
sigh of the oppressed is heard before it. And because this
injustice was borne with patience, the armies of the flowers
of paradise were marshaled. Say, now, whether justice was
done.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I said, ‘It was done.’ And, as a cloud slips off the
moon as she glides upward to the zenith, so fell the veil—but
what I saw I may not tell, nor could, for I weep in remembering
that Beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice faltered even in recollection; nor could I speak
myself. We sat in silence awhile, looking over the Sea of
Lilies with the twilight settling softly upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he resumed: “So I said: ‘Elder Brother, having
seen this, I have all riches and need no more. Take the
land; for I depart into the life of peace, where is no need of
gold or gain, having beheld the ineffable Treasure of the
Nirvana and the very Soul of Quiet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his eyes kindling, he said, ‘What, is it mine—all
mine?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yours. Yet remember that these lilies are of heaven.
It is in my mind that these will have not only pure water and
clean rock but also a clean heart to tend them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, very doubtfully, he took my hand and held it
awhile in his and, dropping it at last, turned, weeping, away.
Thus we parted, and I came to Puto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you never saw him again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>High Illumination smiled, looking to where the star of
evening blossomed above us. “Four years passed,” he replied.
“Then, among the pilgrims who came to the holy
shrines, I saw my brother, and yet could scarcely think it
he, so reverently and with such humility he knelt where the
Divine Lady waits in gold at the left side of the Infinite One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need I recount the rest, O Brother of the Pen? He
came to my cell and, seated at my feet, he told me all.
When I was gone, the lilies withered, and at first he thought
he lacked my skill and spent much money on digging and
trenching, but still the lilies died, and at last he saw that the
air that clung about his garments withered them. So, as he
sat musing on this strange thing, he resolved in his soul that
he would no more sell the Divine in the streets nor market
his peace for gold, but that he would set aside these stones
and pure springs for almsgiving to the poorest of the poor.
Looking up, he said this: ‘Spirit of Compassion, have pity
on my soul, bound and crippled by the love of gain. For I
too am not beyond the bounds of thy pity, and, if there is
hope of it for me in this life as the fruit of some solitary good
deed in former existences, grant that the flowers of heaven
may blossom once more and the souls of many rejoice in
their loveliness.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, as the words were said, he knew that the prayer was
heard. The lilies returned in a beauty beyond telling, and
it seemed that half the world desired them. He who had
not known the joy of giving became now, as it were, the
very source of charity and gave not only of his lilies but of
his rice and millet and all his gains, that the heart of the poor
might be gladdened with plenty. So, as he told, we sat together,
hand in hand, with tongues that could not be satisfied
in telling and eyes that beheld the greatness of the Divine.
And for many years he came, and the monks watched
and watched for his coming and I most of all. And at last
he did not come, but his son in his place, who told me that
the bond of life had been gently loosed, and it was believed
that High Presences stood about his death-bed while the villages
mourned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Brother of the Pen, write this true story, that all may
know there is none like unto the Hearer of Prayer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening star hung like a steadfast lamp over the dim
ocean, and the air was so still that, when at last a faint stirring
came in the grasses and leaves, it was as if some listening
influence were passing softly away, as indeed I believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Skeptics may say that the wish was father to the thought.
But I know better. And as for the flowers themselves, there
is a strange susceptibility in the plant life we call “lower.”
Of that truth I know many stories which I shall tell one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how shall I tell the beauty of Puto looking forth on
its little sisters of the Archipelago with the serenity of a
saint who has attained? I sat alone next day by the carved
Rock of Meditation pondering these things, and bathing my
soul in the peace of them as in deep water. The mystery of
the place was about me, for Puto is a home of the mystic
order of Buddhist monasticism which in India is called
Jhana, in Japan Zen, and there were men at hand to whom
the bond of the flesh is a thing easily unloosed. One sat on
the height above me now in profound meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I analyzed my own heart. Is it because all this with the
atmosphere it creates, is so beautiful that I love it? Or is
it because it presents a truth forgotten, lost, in our hurrying
day of fevered unrest?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because it is of the truth. That is the answer. None
can doubt it who understands and loves these people and
their teachings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None—who is admitted to the quiet of their secret places
and thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a truth which is a part of nature itself. Consider
the lilies of the field. They breathe it, the soft breezes whisper
it among the leaves of the maiden-hair trees, the measured
cadence of the sea chimes it eternally on the golden
shores of Puto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They have the secret of peace, which we have immeasurably
and to our ruin lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So my friend Shan Tao and I paced along the pilgrim’s
path past the sea-cave where visions of the holy Kwan-yin
are said to have been seen in the sun ray that strikes through
the rent roof with something of the same effect as the light
contrived to fall from above in the temple of Mendoet in
Java on the white and beautiful face of the Bodhisattva who
sits in ecstasy below. And wandering on, beguiling the
way with legends and tales of the Excellent Law to reach
the southern monastery, pausing to look at the half ruined
pagoda adorned on its four faces with carvings of Kwan-yin,
and her brother saints, P’uhsien, Wen-shu and Ti-tsang, the
last known in Japan as Jizo the beloved protector of dead
children, we reached the southern monastery and the courtyard
with its noble incense burners and candle holders,
shaded by trees. Here it was a part of my purpose to search
for references in the library on the upper story where the
treasures are guarded by a serene Buddha in alabaster. And
let me say that if ever the libraries of the many Chinese
monasteries are searched with care and patience great additions
will be made not only to the science of the soul but
also to the world’s wisdom. Many lost treasures thus await
their day of resurrection—treasures brought back in the
early days of our era by Chinese monks who made the terrible
pilgrimage through the cruel deserts and mountains to
India that they might return loaded with the spiritual treasures
of illumination and wisdom, and learned comments
and digressions on these written by mighty Chinese patriarchs
whose gilded and lacquered bodies are still preserved
in the remote abodes of faith.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And when that day of revelation comes it will be found
how much of the religious thought of the divided faiths can
be traced to common sources in an antiquity so vast that it
strikes the soul with awe. May that knowledge bring union
and surcease to the petty wranglings and contempts which
cloud the living waters of Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are few scenes more serenely beautiful than the
lotus pond of this monastery and its still waters doubling the
old arched bridge and the sailing clouds, and the sunshine,
unbearably delicious, brooding, brooding upon it like a soul
in ecstasy. A soft collegiate calm was about us, the monks
coming and going at intervals with kindly glances at my pen
and note book, and the reverence for the written character
and for what it represents that contact with our civilization
will most certainly kill. A harmless snake was basking in
the sun not far away, and a deer taught tameness by fellowship
wandered about under the trees, as they do on the island
of Miyajima in Japan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How beautiful the confidence of the creatures in these
Buddhist resorts, how much we lose in losing their companionship!
The gentleness of heaven was on Puto that
day, and the words of a poet-monk who wrote of the beloved
island floated through my mind like little golden clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who tells you that there is no road to heaven? This is
heaven’s own gateway, and through it you may pass direct
to the very Throne of the Divine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left it on a lovely day of summer—no foam-flowers
blossoming on the Sea of Lilies, a drowsy golden haze veiling
the neighbouring islands. I could scarcely have borne to
leave it, especially its unrifled stores of wisdom, had I not
known that I was free of it henceforward and might count
on my welcome, come when I would. Almost, as we crossed
the sea, I could dream that the miraculous ship of Kwan-yin
floated before us, its sails filled with no earthly breeze, bearing
the happy souls to the golden Paradise of the West where
the very perfume of the flowers is audible in song. We who
in Dante read the story of another Boat of Souls may well
recognize the inmost truth of this legend. And certainly in
Puto the soul may at least enter the heavenly Boat of Beauty
that the poets have sung in all tongues and ages, and pass
in it to the blue horizon of dreams and delights.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>THE BRIDE OF A GOD</h1></div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Two hundred years ago in India, many happy people dwelt
in the little town of Krishnapur—happy because their belief
was fixed and immutable and it brought them gladness; for
in all innocence and devotion they worshipped Krishna the
Beloved, the Herdsman of Brindaban, Lord of Love, whose
name their little town carried like a jewel of price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And certainly the God had gifted it with beauty. The
terraced houses climbed the ways of a hill deeply wooded
with tamarind and pippala trees, and down a deep ravine
ran the little Bhadra River, falling from great heights to
feed the blue lake below. The place lay in the sunshine,
clear and bright as a painting on crystal brought by the Chinese
merchants, and by the favour of the God a delicate coolness
spread upward from the lake among the clustered
houses. In its midst was a very small island with a little temple
lifting its shining gilded roof and spires among the palms.
In this he was worshipped as the Flute-Player, an image
of black basalt, very beautiful—a youth with the Flute forever
at his lips; and there were devout men and women who
declared that, in the midnight silence, sounds of music comparable
only to the music of Indra’s heaven had been heard
among the palm trees and mingled with the eternal song of
the river. This report and the beauty and quiet of the fair
little town brought a few pilgrims to bathe in the lake, crowding
the broad low ghats that led down to its pure waters
with their flower-hued garments and the strong chanting of
their prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many legends haunted the town of Krishnapur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Pandit Anand Das was a man learned in the
Vedas and all the sacred books, and his heart glowed with
a great devotion. Since his son, who should have inherited
his learning, was dead, and it could not flow in that beloved
channel, he resolved that, slight and frail as a woman’s intellect
must needs be, he would instruct his daughter Radha
in the mysteries of the Holy Ones, as far as possible. He
had named her Radha from his devotion to Sri Krishna; for
Radha is the heart’s love of the God; and in bestowing this
name he had made offering and prayed that he might live to
see her as beautiful, as true in devotion as the Crowned
Lady. The prayer was answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful indeed was Radha, an image of golden ivory, with
lips like a pomegranate bud before its sweetness is tasted,
and great eyes dark as the midnight and lit by her stars.
Beautiful the soft moulding of her rounded chin, and the
shaping of the flower-face poised on its stem like a champak
blossom that all the bees of love must seek, and the silk-soft
brows and the heavy sweep of shadowy lashes. Flawless
from head to rosy heel as the work of a mighty craftsman
who wills not that his name shall perish, so was Radha; and
when the people saw her as she passed along the little street,
they gave thanks to the Beautiful for her beauty. Fairer
than fair, wiser than wise in all the matters of the Gods, she
lived her quiet days among the palms and temples, and each
day laid its gift at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Brahman, her father, having, as it were, devoted
her to the God, rejoiced to see that <span class='it'>bhakti</span>—which is faith,
love, and worship in a perfect unity—was a steadfast flame
in her heart; nor was there any word to utter her burning
devotion. As a child she would leave all play to sit before
his feet and hear as he read of the divine Krishna,—</p>

<p class='line0'>Beginneth with a Pastoral,—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and her child’s heart lived among the meadows of Brindaban
with the marvellous Child whose very name is ‘He who draws
or attracts.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus her learned father taught her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Krishna is the true incarnation of the Preserver
who upholds the universe. ‘For in him,’ says the Mahabharata
Santeparva, ‘the worlds flutter like birds in water’;
and of him did not Maheshwara the Destroyer say: ‘The
divine and radiant Krishna must be beheld by him who desires
to behold Me.’ Thus in Sri Krishna is all Deity
sheathed in flesh, that the soul of man may dimly apprehend
his glory. A Child—yet thus in the Holy Song does the
Prince Arjun cry to him:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘God, in thy body I see all the Gods,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all the varied hosts of living things,</p>
<p class='line0'>The undivided Thou, the highest point</p>
<p class='line0'>Of human thought.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Can such a Being be approached by mere humanity?
No, he is too far away—the ear of man may not hear, and
the eye of man may not see. How if he were born among
us, if we might touch his feet, and show him in simple human
ways our devotion? How if he would turn the common
earth to beauty by breathing the air we breathe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And because it is so desired, it is done and Krishna is
born, the Herdsman of Brindaban, the Beloved of India.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So reading day by day, he instructed her in the lovely
story of the Childhood, and, with the ancient Pastoral, took
her to the forests and rich cattle pastures where Jumna River
flows wide and still to the sea. The people are kind and
simple, the sacred cows are driven out at dawn to feed, and
brought back in the brief glow of evening by the fair women
who tend the gentle beasts; and this is Brindaban, the home
on earth of the Lord of All, the utterly Adored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much a child! But when floods of rain threatened
to sweep away the herds and their keepers, he raised the
hill Govardhan on the palm of his small soft hand, and sheltered
them from the torrents and the fighting winds. And,
as she sat at his feet, the Pandit showed his child Radha
pictures of that other Child, darkly beautiful, who could
poise the world on his shoulder.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As she grew older, the story widened and deepened with her
years. But as she came to girlhood, her anxious mother,
Sita Bai, ventured with trembling to doubt if it were well to
draw her heart yet closer to the radiant manhood of the
young God; for now the story is to be mystically interpreted
and read by the light of the wisdom of the old and learned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there not Mira Bai, who went mad for the love of
him and could not leave his image or his temple, and dreamed
of his sweetness night and day until she wasted to a shadow
and died? And, my lord, is not his great temple as Jagannath,
Lord of the World, but ten miles from us at the great
town of Chaki; and is it not filled with bands of <span class='it'>devidasis</span>—the
dancing girls? Would you have your daughter as one of
them—sacred but—vile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught the word back on her lips and looked about
her in terror. Then added passionately:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my lord, is it well to kindle such a passion in her heart,
and she little more than a child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better be possessed by that love than by the follies and
wickednesses that haunt the hearts of women to their ruin
and ours. Woman, I know what I do. Be silent!” was all
his answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she was silent, and daily the story went onward and
filled the soul of the girl. For now, as Krishna grew to
manhood, beauty came upon him, irresistible, heart-compelling,
the world’s Desire, and on the banks of Jumna
was sung the Song of Songs—the Lover, dark and glorious,
to whom the souls of all the women of Brindaban, whether
wife or maid, cling passionately, forgetful of self and of all
but him. And the deepest symbol of the adoration of
Krishna is the passion of man for woman and woman for
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk warily here, my child, if you would understand,”
said the Pandit; “for we move among pitfalls made by the
mind of man fettered to his senses—the mind of man, that
coin bearing the double superscription of spirit and flesh.
Yet the story is plain for him who has ears to hear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Radha, speechless, with dark eyes filled with adoring
love, listened—listened, with no heart for aught else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me more, more!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, seeing the Divine Passion, the trembling of her
lips, the uttering of her heart, told on, imparting the desire
of the God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when, as at this time, a marriage was spoken of for
her with the son of the rich Brahman Narayan, she shrank
from it with such shuddering horror that for very pity her
father put it by for a while. But her mother watched in
great fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And every evening, when the light was calm and golden
and her father laid his books aside, she would sit before
him, putting all else aside that she might drink in the sweet
nectar of his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he told of the Herd-maidens bathing in the clear
ripple of the river where the trees hang in green shadow over
the deep pools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their garments lie on the bank, forgotten in the joy of
youth and life, as they sing the praises of the Beloved, until
at length one remembers and looks, and lo! some thief
has stolen the vesture, and they stand ashamed in the crystal
lymph, their long locks gathered about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who has so bereft them? For no man or woman should
bathe uncovered; and they have sinned—they know it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then a voice calls from the world of leaves above their
heads, and there sits the Desired, shining like a star caught
in the topmost boughs, and before him are rolled the stolen
garments, and when, all shamefaced, they entreat for their
restoration, the Voice exhorts them:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if it is for My sake you have bathed and purified
yourselves, then come forth fearless, and receive your vesture
from my hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he laid in her hand the picture of the Gopis fearing
and adoring as they leave the lustral water, some shrinking
in humility, to receive their vesture from the Beautiful, who
sits smiling far above them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this, my daughter, is a very great mystery!” he said
gravely. “And its meaning is this: ‘Thy <span class='it'>Thou</span> is still
with thee; if thou wilt attain unto me, quit thyself, and
come.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, surely the Self is withered into nothing when this
dearworthy One calls. What were life, death—anything
in the Three Worlds, compared with beholding his blissful
countenance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he replied,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so it is”; and laid aside his book and fell into a
deep musing on the Perfections of the Lord; and Radha sat
beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that night her mother said timidly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord of my life, the girl is possessed by the God. I fear
for her life. In her sleep she speaks aloud of him and
stretches empty arms to the air, moaning. The colour fades
in her lips, her eyes are fixed on dreams. She has no peace.
Should we not seek an earthly lover for her own, that she
may forget this Divine that is all the world’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he replied sternly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman, lift up a grateful heart to the God that this girl
is not as the rest but consumed by the love of the Highest.
I have a thought unknown to you. All will be better than
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she desisted in great fear and obedience; but the very
next evening was the story told of Radha—heart of the God’s
heart, the Beautiful whose name she herself bore! And the
girl listened in an ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very still evening, the stars shining large and near
the earth, the moon a mere crescent, such as when Maheshwara
wears it in his hair and dreams on the mountain-peaks
of Himalaya. They sat in the wide veranda, supported
on wooden pillars bowered in the blossoms of the purple
bougainvillæa and the white and scented constellations of
jasmine. The wide transparent blinds of split cane were
raised to admit the faintly perfumed breath of the garden;
and by the Pandit’s elbow, as he sat on his raised seat,
burned a little oil lamp, that he might read the sacred pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Radha sat on her low cushion beside him, the <span class='it'>sari</span> of
Dakka muslin threaded with gold fallen back from her head
as she looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘In the passion of their worship, the women of Brindaban
are drawn out into the forest, each grieving if he do but turn
his calm immortal eyes upon any other than herself.
Therefore, only in the secret places of the forest is there now
any joy. It has left the little houses and gone out to dwell
by the river. They must follow, for they bear the world’s
wound in their heart, and he is its Balm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘For a time his eyes rest on Radha the Beautiful, and she,
transported with the pride of love, entreats that he will carry
her in his arms. He stretches them to her with his mystic
smile, and even as they touch her, he vanishes, and she is
alone in a great darkness.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here again, my daughter, is the parable clear,” the
Pandit interrupted the reading to say. “Here is no room for
spiritual pride and exclusive desire. Learn your place,
proud soul! It is at his feet until he, unasked, shall raise
you to the level of his heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So at the last she falters and falls, stunned with grief,
the Herd-maidens weeping beside her, and—suddenly the
Light shines. He has returned. He speaks:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now I have tried you. You have remembered and
thought upon me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have increased your affection like beggars made
newly rich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have chosen my service, abandoning the world and
the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How can I do you honour? I cannot reward you
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Though I should live for a hundred of Brahma’s years,
yet I could not be free of my debt.’ ”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>She sat in silence; and breaking upon it, they heard the
soft tread of a man stop by their gate, and voices, and the
servant who guarded the gate came in haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Sir, here is the holy Brahman who is chief at the
altar of great Jagannath in Chaki, and he would speak with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring him instantly hither. Stay! I go myself!” cried
the Pandit, rising. He had forgotten his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, have I your leave to go?” She drew the sari
about her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daughter, no. This is a wise man and great. Be reverent
and humble, and stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood, trembling with fear to see one so holy. Surely
it was a portent that the servant of the God should come on
their reading. Yet she quieted her heart, and when her father,
attending the great guest, placed him on his own seat,
with the image of the wise Elephant-Headed One wreathing
his trunk behind him, she bowed before him and touched
his feet, for to her he was as Brahman and priest, an
earthly God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man in middle life, tall and dignified in spite
of a corpulence which gained upon him, and his features
clear-cut in the proud lines that denoted his unstained ancestry.
He knew himself the superior of kings. He would
have spurned with his foot a jewel touched by the
Mogul Emperor of India. Yet more. Had the Rajput
Rana, a king of his own faith, sun-descended, royal, cast his
shadow on his food in passing, he had cast it, polluted, away.
So great is the pride of the Brahmans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Namaskar, Maharaj! What is your honoured pleasure?”
asked the Pandit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am on my way to Dilapur on the divine business,” he
answered, with a voice like the lowest throbbing notes of
the bronze temple gong. “But I would have a word with
you, Brother, as I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has my daughter your leave to depart, Maharaj?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, friend, though it is of her I come to speak.
May I behold the face of the maiden? A Brahmani has no
need to veil it. They are not secluded like the Toorki
women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unveil before the Presence, my daughter, Radha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guest started at the name so familiar to him in his
devotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is singular, in view of my errand, that you should have
given her this holy name, Pandit-ji.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She deserves it for the devoted love that she bears to
Sri Krishna,” returned her father. “Of her face I say nothing,
but her heart is flawless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well!” said the priest Nilkant Rai, and turned
gravely to Radha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many were the <span class='it'>devidasis</span>, the nautch girls of the God, in
the Temple of Jagannath. His eyes, deep and glowing,
were no strangers to beauty, for the fairest were gathered
like flowers to adorn the altars of the God, to dance and sing
before his divine dreams, in all things to abide his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six thousand priests serve Sri Krishna as Jagannath, Lord
of the Universe, at Chaki, for great is his splendour. The
Raja of Dulai, royal though he be, is the sweeper of his
house. More than twenty thousand men and women do his
pleasure, and of the glories of his temple who can speak?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But never had Nilkant Rai beheld such beauty as trembled
before him then—darkly lovely, whitely fair, the very
arrows of desire shooting from the bow of her sweet lips,
half-child, half-woman, wholly desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes roved from the wonder of her face to the delicate
rounding of her young breasts and the limbs exquisitely expressed,
yet hidden, by the sari.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked in silence, then turned to the Pandit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely she is an incarnation of Radha in face as in name.
Brother, she has my leave to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, when she had fled like a shadow, Nilkant Rai did
not hasten. The other waited respectfully. <span class='it'>Pañ</span>—the betel
for chewing—was offered in a silver casket. A garland of
flowers perfumed with attar of roses was placed about the
guest’s neck. Refreshments were served and refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he spoke, looking on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, it is known to you that the God makes choice
when he will of a bride, favoured above all earthly women.
Beautiful must she be, pure as a dewdrop to reflect his glory
and return it in broken radiance, young, devout— Surely,
even in this land of devotion, it is not easy to find such a
one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not easy, holy one!” returned the Pandit, trembling
as he foreknew the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other continued calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it so chanced that the priest Balaram passed lately
through this town, and going by the tank to the temple, beheld
your daughter, and returning, he came to me and said:
‘The God has shown the way. I have seen the Desire of
his eyes.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great is the unlooked-for honour,” said the Pandit
trembling violently; “so great that her father and mother
bend and break beneath it. But consider, Holy One—she
is an only child. Have pity and spare us! The desolate
house—the empty days!” His voice trailed broken into
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this hides reluctance!” Nilkant Rai began sternly.
“If you have given a foul belief to any tale of the Temple——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, holy Sir! I have heard nothing. What should I
hear?” The old man’s voice was feeble with fear. “Do
I disparage the honour? Sri Krishna forbid! No, it is but
the dread of losing her—the empty, empty house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is she not at the age when marriage becomes a duty,
and would she not leave you then? Unreasonable old man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Sir—Maharaj, I tremble before the honour. But
if the girl married, she would bring her babe and make her
boast and gladden our hearts. But thus she is lost to us.
Have pity! There are other Brahmans rich in daughters.
Take not the one from my poverty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nilkant Rai rose to his feet with majesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go. Never shall the God be rejected and ask twice.
But when your daughter, old and haggard, looks up at you,
answer that it was her unworthy father who kept her as a
drudge on earth, when he might have raised her to a throne
in heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the old man stood with clasped hands, Radha broke
from the shadows and threw herself before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, would you hold me back? What joy, what
glory in all the world can befall your child like this? The
bride of the God! O Father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears were running down her face like rain. They
glittered in the lamplight. He could not meet her eyes.
Nilkant Rai stood by, silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is beautiful as a nymph of Indra’s heaven!” he
thought. “Not Urvasi and Menaka, the temptresses of
sages, were more lovely!” He said aloud;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maiden is right. She is worthy of the God’s embrace.
Is there more to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maharaj, I worship you!” said the old man submissively
(and still he had not looked at his child). “It is well.
What orders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her be perfumed and anointed daily. Let her food
and drink be purer than the pure. Let her worship daily at
the temple of Sri Krishna. The bridal shall be held in a
month from this, that time being auspicious. The Car of
her Lord shall come for her as the Queen she is, and all envy
the Chosen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to Radha, still at her father’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, happiest Lady. Joys earthly and celestial
await you. Rest in the knowledge of the favour of Sri
Krishna. Hear of him, dream of him, until the glad truth
slays all dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved slowly toward the steps. Her father pursued
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maharaj. Forgive, forgive! I neglect my manners.
Thanks a thousandfold for the honour you have condescended
to bring us this happy day. Your commands are
ever before me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words poured forth. He could not say enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well, Pandit-ji. It is well. Say no more!” said the
great guest, striding onward to the gate where two other
Brahmans and his <span class='it'>palki</span> awaited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood in the shadows as the Pandit returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, beloved, did I do wrong? Have you not taught
me all my life that there is none like him—none?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My pearl, what is done is done. He cannot be resisted.
It is well your heart goes with your feet. Now sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed in silently, and sat all night by the small cotton
mattress laid on the floor. How could she sleep?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was there sleep for the Pandit. Sita Bai needed
little telling, for she had listened behind the curtains; and
now, with a livid pallor upon her, she confronted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord of my life, what is there to say? You know—you
know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he answered heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sita Bai was too dutiful a wife to reproach her husband
with anything done; but his own thoughts returned to the
long evenings spent in contemplating the Perfections of the
God. He replied to his thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet had she never heard his name, it had been the same.
Nothing could have saved her from the temple of Jagannath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saved.” He caught the word back from his own lips in
deadly fear, and added in haste: “Whom the God honours
cannot set his grace aside, and there is none who would.
None in heaven or earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” echoed the woman faintly. Then, in a whisper
scarcely to be heard, “Whom Nilkant Rai chooses”—and
steadily averted her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They dared say no more of this even in whispers to each
other; for if this were reported, grief, ruin, death were the
sure end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One word more did Anand Pandit breathe:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She must keep her joy. It is the God’s. If he love her,
he yet may save her. Let no word be said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She touched his feet in token of submission. All night
they sat in a bitter silence.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Next day, all through the little holy town, bathing in its
glad sunshine beneath the swaying palms, had run the news
of this honour. Sita Bai, with a mask of gladness fixed on
her face, visited the wife of the goldsmith, and begged her
sympathy with the divine event. The gold bangles rang
as she joined her hands; for she had come clad in splendour,
and her sari was of purple silk of Paitan woven with strands
of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Radha went with her mother to the temple, crowds
of the simple people had gathered by the lake beneath the
neems and tamarinds to behold the beauty beloved of the
God. True, they had seen it before, but to-day it was
strange and new. Her throat rose like the stem of the lotus
above the snowy folds of her sari, and like the purity of the
lotus was her face with its downward eyes hidden in heavy
lashes. She moved already like a bride, a little apart from
her mother, to whom she had clung hitherto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice shouted, “Jai Krishna!” (Victory to Krishna),
and many voices took up the cry. A woman, quivering with
eagerness, flung a garland of wet marigolds about her neck.
Flowers were strewn before her happy feet. Never before
had a Bride been chosen from Krishnapur. It might well
seem the benediction of the God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful woman, in a sari of jade-green and silver,
pressed up close to her and whispered,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray for me, O Beautiful, when you lie in the arms of
the God, for me Ramu, wife of Narayan the Sahoukhar, that
I may bear a son. Surely he will grant it for a wedding
gift!” She stooped to the feet of Radha to worship her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will pray,” the bride answered, pacing gently onward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Petitions poured in upon her as she moved through the
dappled light and shadow of the trees, beside the melted
jewels of the lake. A great gladness possessed her. It was
as if the air upbore her light feet; and the people followed
in crowding joy until she made the <span class='it'>ashtanga</span>—the great
prostration before the Flute-Player, the Alone, the Beautiful,
who moves through the world scattering joy and love with
the far music of his Flute—He to whom all and none may
draw near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the people were gone and the sun had set, and quiet
breathed from the grey garments of evening, she entreated
her father to read to her from the Song of Songs, written
by the sweet-voiced singer Jayadeva, who has sounded all
the secrets of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he hesitated, then with a strange look upward, he
read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘This is the story of the anguish of Radha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘For Radha, jasmine-bosomed, beautiful, waited in vain

lingers on the banks of Jumna with the happy herd-maids,
while the <span class='it'>koels</span> flute their soft <span class='it'>koo-hoo-oo</span> in the deep green
shade. And the poet makes the invocation:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘ “Krishna, Lord of Love, stoop from thy throne to aid us.

nuptials of the soul and her Bridegroom.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Pandit paused, his voice trembling, with the dark

<p class='pindent'>And again he paused, the words choking in his throat,

<p class='line0'>Uprose to drink her beams.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He laid the book aside and extinguished the little lamp,
so that only the moonlight was about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, he said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter, the God leads you in strange ways. Yet,
whatever the hearts of men, he is true. Offer him your
heart in all purity, and in the end it shall be well with you.
We will speak of this no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Father beloved, do you not share my joy?” she said
tremulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The days went by very swiftly to the time of the divine
marriage. Messengers came and went between the mighty
temple of Jagannath and little Krishnapur, bearing gifts and
jewels. Casting half-contemptuous glances, they passed by
the little shrine where the Bride worshipped daily; but all
contempt died when they were admitted to see her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The God has chosen well!” they said, and looked at one
another with meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the great day dawned in a passion of sunlight, and with
flutes and drums and shouting the great Car of Jagannath
waited for the Bride; and as she came forth, the
pomegranate-blossom flush of joy rising in her golden
cheek, her parents bowed before her and touched her feet
in worship—no longer their daughter, but a goddess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ankleted and zoned with gold, clothed in woven gold so
supple that it yielded to every breath, the sun-rays dazzled
back from her upon the adoring crowd until they put up
their hands to veil the splendour. And so she sat, a Radiance,
for all the world to see, high on the Car wreathed and
hung with flowers, the image of the Bridegroom beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, wonderful, terrible greatness for a woman! And so,
with songs and triumph they bore her to her bridal.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Mighty is the Temple of Jagannath, where by the eternal
sea the people crowd all day to worship the Lord of the
Universe. In little Krishnapur, he is the Beloved, the
Herdsman, the Beautiful. Here, he is far removed—too
great for love or fear. Human thought quails before his
Vastness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The temple is in itself a city, and no feet but those of
worshippers may pass even the strong outward walls. Very
glorious are the carvings that adorn it. Terrible figures
of Gods, many-headed, many-armed, bending giant bows,
trampling giant enemies, brandishing awful weapons, dandling
on their knees great Goddesses with slender loins and
full breasts that overweight their swaying grace. Very
awful are these figures, with clustering hair and crowns
above their long eyes, and suns and moons rising and setting
on their brows, and the symbols of their might scattered
about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was night, and it was among the wildly tossing
lights that the Bride approached the home of her Lord; and
the temple was dreadful, for it was dark and all the intricate
ways lit with flickering points of light like the eyes
of beasts; and, lost among strangers, her heart turned to
water; for it resembled a great cave of blackness, and she
could see but the naked bodies of worshippers and giant images
of the holy Gods hovering through thick air laden with
incense fumes and burning <span class='it'>ghi</span> and the dung of the sacred
animals and the pungent smell of rotting marigolds. And
there were cauldrons with flames fed by wild worshippers
from the hills, and these crowded about the <span class='it'>palki</span> wherein
they brought her through the temple, and touched it with
hands that made her tremble, imploring her prayers as she
lay in the breast of the God. Bats hung from the roof or
swooped in the gloom. Their sourness tainted the air, and
men, dim as ghosts, slunk about the fearful ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus dwell the Gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly terror submerged her like an ocean wave,
and she sank back and the world left her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When sense and memory returned, she lay in her <span class='it'>palki</span> in
the great Hall of Dancing—a mighty hall supported on
many pillars; and around her stood in motionless bands the
<span class='it'>devidasis</span>, the dancers of the God, chosen to delight his
senses for their grace and beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, seeing her stretch her hands for help, the wild and
flying dance began. They lifted her from the <span class='it'>palki</span> and she
stood among them, shimmering in gold, and about her they
wheeled, advancing and retiring, linking and unlinking like
dancers in a dream. And they sang the marriage song she
had heard in the quiet of her home; but now it was terrible
as it burst from hundreds of throats, gonged and cymbaled,
with clashing and a thunder-beat of drums.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Enter, thrice-Happy, enter, thrice-Desired,</p>
<p class='line0'>And let the gates of Hari shut thee in.</p>
<p class='line0'>Tremble not. Lay thy lovely shame aside</p>
<p class='line0'>And love him with the love that knows not fear.</p>
<p class='line0'>Give him the drink of amrit from thy lips.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>She stood like one clinging to a surf-beaten rock as they
tossed about her with wild hands and eyes, the whole world
mad with noise and dance and colour; then, dropping on her
knees, she covered her eyes in terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus the servants of the God welcomed her to his
arms.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Night, and a great quiet. A chamber of gold set with
jewels glittering in the moonlight that came down some
secret way, borne on a cool breath from the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay alone in the golden place, and the jewels watched
her like eyes. Was it terror, was it love that possessed
her? A thousand images blurred her closed eyes—He, the
Beautiful, with peacock crown, with eyes that draw the soul,
with lips of indescribable sweetness. It could not be that
she should lie close to the heart of the God. How dare
flesh and blood aspire to that mystic marriage? Must they
not perish in the awful contact? And, if it could be, how
return to earth after that ecstasy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I know and die!” she prayed. “Oh, let me not
pass unknowing! Let me know and die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the minutes dropped by, this prayer was all her
thought, and it possessed her being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, dividing the darkness, she heard the voice of a
Flute very far off. Like a silver mist, it spread vaporous,
a small fine music, but growing, drawing nearer, and, as it
strengthened, clear drops of music fell through this mist
like honey from the black bees’ comb. It crept about her
brain and steeped her eyes as if in poppy juice, so sweet,
so gliding, most infinitely wooing as it grew and filled the
air with peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in this high marvel was a blissful safety beyond all
words, more sweet and delectable than any man may tell.
The grace of his Childhood, of the dearworthy passage of
his blessed Feet among men, returned to her with a joy that
melted her heart with love. And so she rose and stood upon
her feet, as one called, trembling with blissful longing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far down the long ways, passing through pools of moonlight
and dark, came One whom the music followed. His
face could not at first be seen; about him was a leopard
skin. Naked but for this, beautiful and slender, his silent
feet moved onward. Like one utterly alone in a great forest,
he came,—slowly,—lost in some unutterable thought, made
audible in sweet sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bride, the Lover, and between them, the music and
the moonlight only. She would have knelt, but her feet were
fixed; and he drew near with unseeing eyes—O Beautiful, O
wholly desirable, to draw the hearts of men! And still
the Face Divine was hidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he drew near and would have passed, she cried
aloud with a passionate glad cry, “My Lord indeed!” rejoicing
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he turned and looked upon his Bride with heavens
in his eyes. And as she saw what no words can utter, she
fell upon his feet and lay, slain sweetly with a bliss more
keen than any pain.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But the Brahman, Nilkant Rai, waiting behind the pillar
to seize his prey, had heard and seen nothing of the Glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she fell, he sprang like a tiger on a fawn, and lifted
the fair dead body, and stumbled in the trailing hair, and
knew his vileness conquered. And in that moment the Eye
of Destruction opened upon him the beam that withers
worlds and hurls them like shriveled leaves into the Abyss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he dropped her and stumbled screaming into the
dark, a leper white as snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they came in the dawn to implore the will of
the God from the happy lips that his had blessed, the Bride
lay at rest on the dim straight golden bed, and between her
breasts was a Flute set with strange jewels that no man
could name. Nor shall they ever; for when they laid her
body on the pyre they left this Flute in her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Anand Das heard what had befallen, he said
this:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did the Herdsman sleep on his guard or the Beloved
fail the heart that loved Him? It is well, and better
than well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he who tells this story ends it thus:—</p>

<h3>A STORY FROM THE MAHABHARATA</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Reverence to Ganesha, Lord of the Elephant Trunk, that,
in a day found fortunate, he aid me to tell this tale, which
whoso heareth shall receive prosperity in this world and in
that other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the age of the ancestors there dwelt a great King in
Vidarbha, with a Queen of the highest grace and beauty,
and these did all things pleasing to the gods, making rich
gifts to Brahmans and honouring kine, and in reward for
these things the gods gave to them three sons and a daughter,
and this was Damayanti, the loveliest of earthly women.
And she was known throughout the universe as the “Consumer
of Hearts”; for the very report of her beauty agitated
the hearts of thousands who might never hope to see it.
Slender-waisted was she and stately as a young palm-tree,
and though she was a mortal, Sri, the wife of Narayana,
had dowered her with her own eyes, black and soft and so
long-lidded that they all but touched the silken hair upon
her temples. The very gods in the Paradise of Indra heard
the report of this marvel and coveted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as Damayanti, like a crescent moon, rounded into
maidenhood, it so befell that her maidens in talk together
praised none but that Tiger among Men, Nala the Prince.
For they said: “This Prince overpasses all men, and what
shall be said of him? Surely he is laughing, bold and handsome
as Kama, the God of Love—he whose bow is strung
with honey-bees, sweet and stinging. The arrows of his
eyes are pointed with five-tongued flame. All hearts burn
in his glances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Damayanti silently heard and pondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the report of her had in like manner reached Nala,
and sweet thoughts grew up in him for the slender-waisted
maid. And he dreamed of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it chanced that one day, wandering in the great
woods that surrounded his palace, he saw a flock of swans,
white and beautiful as though washed in the waters of
Lake Manasarovar, that cold jewel of the Himalaya, and
indeed they were of that royal race of swans who, dwelling
there, feed only on unpierced seed-pearls, and therefore are
they so white. So, as they drew together, the Prince,
stealing noiseless as a snake through the jungle, seized one,
for love of its whiteness, and held the long throat clutched in
his hands and the plumed wings beneath his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in those days royal men had understanding of the
lesser creatures of the gods, and that king-swan spoke and
Nala heard his speech: “O Tiger among Men, slay me not.
To me also is my life dear and precious! Have pity, for I
will do good service. I will fly through many leagues of
air, and in the ear of the Princess Damayanti will I say that
of all men you are the noblest and stateliest. And having
heard this, she will greatly desire you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And by the favour of Kama, the Prince withdrew his
hands, saying, “Swan, observe your promise; for this is the
duty of the honourable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the swan, inclining his head, flew away with his companions,
having instructed them as to the course they should
pursue on alighting in the gardens of Vidarbha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in the garden-close the Princess and her maidens
played, and she excelled them all, though each was fair.
And the swans, seeing these lovely ones among the flowers,
fluttered to earth and stood near them, arching their necks
and preening their feathers, and their whiteness delighted
the Princess and she said, laughing: “Chase these swans,
each one a swan; for it appears that they desire captivity at
our hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And every maiden pursued a swan, with laughter and
sweet cries, and as each all but seized her swan, the swan
eluded her and fluttered a little farther. Most lovely of
all sights was it to behold the maidens and the swans, as,
equal in beauty, they fluttered hither and thither among
the flowers and the trees. And Damayanti, laughing with
her voice of music, pursued her swan, she also, that lovely
lady of the long eyes, not knowing that her heart was the
destined prey of the swan she sought to capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, when her hands were even upon the snow of his
plumage, that king-swan eluded her again and spoke in
the speech of man, and in amazement she stood to hear
what he would say, as he inclined his head before her feet.
“Lady, O Most Beautiful, Damayanti, Consumer of Hearts,
there is a Prince in Nishada, and his name—oh, mark it well—is
Nala. As the Twin Stars shine in the sky, so he shines
among men. Surely we swans, flying in the pure air, see all
men and divine beings and the great gods. But we have
seen none like unto Nala. Pearl among Women, if you
should wed this Prince of Princes, were it not better than
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Damayanti heard this, she looked sidelong
through her lashes like a maid, for she was young and
tender, and she said this, very softly: “Dear swan—white
swan! Fly and tell this thing to the Prince.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that white beauty, the feeder on pearls, said, “Hearing
and obeying, I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with strong strokes of his pinions he rose into the
sky, followed by his mates, and clove the air to Nishada and
told the Prince her word, being the destined messenger of
love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he carried the heart of the maid upon his wings; for
Damayanti sat her down upon the flowers and, when her
ladies returned from chasing the swans, they found her with
her hand pressed upon her empty bosom and tears welling
like jewels from the dark deeps of her eyes. And though
they entreated her to speak and reveal the cause of her
grief, she would say nothing but this one thing: “All is
well—and ill! Trouble me no further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they returned, sighing, to the palace, with Care
among them for a companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Damayanti wanned and paled. Like a caged jungle-dweller
would she pace up and down, unresting, her eyes
upon the ground. Food lost its savour, and what was sleep
but a weariness? And in the garden-close she sat in her
gold gown and watched the peacocks displaying their
splendour to the sun as they danced before the rains, and
she only prayed for wings that she might fly to Nishada.
Very full of mischief were the words of that swan!</p>

<p class='pindent'>So her royal mother, instructed by the maidens that the
Princess pined away daily, went to her lord, the King, and
said: “Such and such is the case of our daughter. Do
then according to your wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the King pondered the thing deeply; for he loved
his daughter, and he answered: “I perceive she is no
longer a child. Youth and maidenhood are waxing in her,
and who can gainsay them? It is now fitting that she make
her choice among princes and kings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the careful King, having considered, sent forth this
message to the courts of kings: “Lords of the Earth, it is
with us an ancient and honourable custom that the daughters
of kings make choice of a husband suitable to their degree
and royalty; nor do we force them to unchosen marriages.
And this is known as the <span class='it'>swayamvara</span> of a king’s
daughter. My Princess is now of due age to choose her
lord. Come therefore to the swayamvara of Damayanti,
receiving honourable welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the news flew like gongs and drums over the land; for
there was no man but knew of the loveliness of the Consumer
of Hearts, and each one thought within himself, “She
will choose me, and yet if not, still shall I see that face of
faces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So from every country came processions to the court of
Vidarbha: trains of elephants walking slowly beneath the
weight of the gold and silver castles upon their backs, where
sat the kings of men; horses with jewelled saddles and
bridles, the very stirrups glittering with clarified gems that
the feet of kings might tread upon them; glorious companies
of fighting-men, bearing their pennons; archers with bows
tipped with ivory, strung until they sang like the strings
of the <span class='it'>sitar</span> in the wind. So in armies they came until the
earth groaned beneath their feet, and the great camps were
set about Vidarbha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also came Nala the Prince, gallantly accompanied, riding
to Vidarbha, and thoughts of love were thick as honey-bees
in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who shall discern the thoughts of the Gods?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it chanced that two great saints, Narada and Parvata,
mighty in their austerities, pure and high of thought,
ascended the heavens at that time, to make a visit and
obeisance to Indra the God, in his own Paradise. And he,
the King of the Clouds, rising to them, did them honour
and welcomed them; for the presence of the saints is as a
rich perfume in the nostrils of the gods. Therefore he
saluted the two, asking tidings of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Narada replied: “High God, it is well with
the world. It is well with the kings. There is no complaint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Indra spoke again: “But where are my fighters—the
kings of men? Do they not love—do they not fight
as of old? I see no souls of haughty warriors entering my
heaven. Is it all peace? Where are my fighting-men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Narada made reply: “O Cloudy God, all is peace
upon the earth, and there is no thought but of beauty:
the King of Vidarbha makes the choosing for his daughter
and the kings and princes dream of naught else; for she
is the very Lotus of the World and the Pearl of Women.
And the kings flock as one man to Vidarbha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while Narada said this, the Immortals gathered to
hear, and when he spoke of the maid Damayanti, their
eyes shot forth peculiar radiance and they said: “To this
maid’s choosing we four will go. She is worthy to choose
among the deathless rather than the kings, and she shall
reign in the Paradise of Indra and sit beside that divinity
whose bride she wills to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Indra, the Cloudy God, said, “I will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Agni, the Lord of Fire, said, “I also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Varuna, the King of Waters, said, “And I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Dark Presence that is Yama, the Lord of Death,
said, “I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So their winged chariots that are self-directed, flying like
thought where they will, awaited them, and the gods ascended
them and, thinking of Vidarbha, were presently beside
its walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nala the Prince, approaching with his company of
great men and soldiers, elated with love and hope, looked
up and beheld the Gods, seated in their golden chariots.
And these, the Protectors of the World, saw him and hesitation
in their purpose seized them, because he shone like the
sun and was a man indeed, and their divine hearts adjudged
him worthy even of Damayanti—so straight and tall he
stood and like a king’s lance, and in the beauty of his brows
and strength of his person was there no blemish from head
to foot. Even like their own brother, Kama, the God of
Love, so he seemed to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, descending through the clouds and softening their
divine voices that human ears might abide them, they accosted
him: “Aho! Prince of Nishada—Prince Royal!
We have an errand. We have need of a noble messenger.
Who will go for us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did homage, pressing his palms together, answering:
“I see Four Shining Ones. I will go. What is
your errand, that I may do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Indra, leaning from his chariot, said this: “The Gods
stand before you, Prince of Nishada. I am Indra, the King
of the Clouds, and he beside me is Agni, the Lord of Fire,
and here, Varuna, the King of Waters, and he behind me is
Yama, the Lord of Death. Go now to Damayanti the Princess,
and say this to her: ‘The Protectors of the World, the
Four Great Gods, desiring your beauty, are come to the swayamvara.
Make choice then to which of these Great Ones
your heart inclines; for that dignity whom you shall choose
is yours, O maiden of excelling fortune.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nala, joining his hands in prayer, said to Indra:
“O Mighty, how can I do this? O Mightinesses, anything
but this! I, too, have journeyed to Vidarbha, desiring the
maid. How should I entreat for another, even for a god?
Being divine, have pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these divinities replied: “Have you not said, ‘I go’?
Is it possible that a royal man should break his word? It is
not possible. The great forswear themselves in nothing.
Depart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he said: “Her gates are guarded; for she is a king’s
daughter. A man may have no secret speech with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Indra answered: “But that may you! Fear not.
Depart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the divine voice ceased, the Prince stood in the
inmost chamber of Damayanti. He knew not how; yet
he was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his eyes swam and his heart fluttered within him;
for she sat with her maids like a goddess and his heart
knew her. Beautiful was she and yet more than beautiful;
for all grace, all love shone about her as the light surrounds
the moon in her interlunar caves. So a mild radiance filled
the air about the Princess and moved as she moved, going
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, when these ladies beheld a man standing in their
presence, they sprang up like frightened deer, each grasping
the other for protection and gathering about the Princess
to shield her, so great was their fear. Then, seeing
the kindliness of his beauty and the nobility of his brows,
these lovely ones gathered courage and they saluted him
with timidity, murmuring: “Aho, his grace! Aho, his
beauty! What is he? Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Princess, her heart fluttering like a leaf in the
wind, stood higher than the rest and spoke thus: “Noble
Prince—for by a faultless body I judge you royal—how
have you come thus suddenly like a God? Surely this would
anger my father. Have you no fear of his wrath?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was love in her voice and with love the Prince
answered: “O Most Lovely, I am Nala of Nishada, and I
am the herald of the gods. For to your choosing come
the Four, almighty, heaven-shining—Indra the King of
the Clouds, Agni of the Fire, Varuna of the Waters, and
he whom to name is fear, Yama, the Lord of Death. And
these will that you choose one among them to be your immortal
lord, and it is by their power that I stand before you.
Who am I to be the messenger of the Great Ones? Now
judge what is well; for this is an honour to shake the soul
of a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Damayanti bowed her fair head in reverence, hearing
the gods named, and having done obeisance, she raised
her head and spoke: “Yet, O Prince, is my heart set on
you and I am faithful. The white swan was my messenger
and to you he bore my love. It is for your sake only that
the kings are bidden to my swayamvara, but I have already
chosen. Even now the maidens make ready the garland
that I would hang about your neck. O Prince of Men, O
Flame of Strength and Knightliness, what says your heart?
For me, I choose your arms or death. There is no other
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, sighing bitterly, said: “With the very Gods
awaiting you, how, Princess, should you choose a man?
And what am I but dust beneath their feet? But you, O
lady, choosing one of these excelling Gods, shall escape all
death and mortality and reign shining beside him throughout
the ages; for immortal flowers do not wither, and death and
time are unknown to such as these. Sit therefore enthroned
above us. Choose and, choosing, be divine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she replied in haste and weeping: “Before these
mighty Gods I bow. To them I address my prayers, but
you I choose—you only will I take for my husband. You
only. What to me is immortal life if I have not you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her body trembled like a bamboo in the wind, while
he replied: “Here being their messenger, I may not speak
for myself. Duty and reverence hold the door of my lips.
Yet if the time come when in honour I may speak, then will
I utter what lies in my heart. May that time come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it come!” said the Princess and dashed the tears
from her eyes, and like a queen she stood and said: “In
full presence of my father and of the kings let these Divine
Ones enter, and, O Prince, who are the light of my sad eyes,
enter you, too, and I, a free maiden, will choose freely. And
to you, what blame? For it is I who choose and the gods
know all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he returned to the Gods and, sighing, told what had
befallen, bidding them to the swayamvara of Damayanti,
the Consumer of Hearts. So the Shining Ones knew that
her heart was set upon Nala of Nishada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, on an auspicious day and in the right quarter of
the moon, the swayamvara was held in a mighty court surrounded
by golden pillars bound with garlands, and with
royal seats set for the suitors. And closing it in was a great
gatehouse with guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the gates passed the kings to their places, and
what a sight was there as these noblest of the earth approached!
How should a woman choose among them?
Crowned were they with odorous blossoms pressed down
upon their dark locks. Lordly jewels swung in their ears.
Some were rough in majesty, great-thewed, and the muscles
stood out upon them like cords. Some were delicate in
strength like bows of the archer Gods, but splendid kings
were all, proud and fierce of aspect, fit spouses for such
beauty; and in a ring they sat, their eyes glittering and fixed
upon the way that Damayanti should enter, desiring that
loveliness as the very crown jewel of their state. But none
saw the Gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And into that ring of set faces entered the Princess, unveiled
and pacing like a deer, and on her right hand her
brother Danta, and the garland of choosing on her arm, and
when she entered all held their breath, so more than mortal
fair she seemed, and they knew that the half was not told
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, with her soul set on Nala of Nishada, the Princess
Damayanti went by the kings, and, as she passed each one,
his face darkened as when a cloud crosses the sun and the
world is grey. So at last she stood before Nala and raised
her eyes under the cloud of her beautifully bent lashes, and
fear and pain shot through her tender heart like an arrow,
for lo, the Four Shining Ones had condescended to take the
earthly shape of Nala as they stood beside him, so that they
might try the maid and she not know her love. There were
five Nalas, and which was her own she could in no way tell,
for each one bore his very face, his very form. So the Gods
walk disguised, and who shall know them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, sore perplexed, trembling in her great fear and
reverence, she sought, meditating, to recall the signs by
which the Gods may be discerned when they assume flesh.
But of these none could she see, and the five remained immovable
as she stood before them and in silence the kings
watched what would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, seeing no help in herself or anywhere on earth, that
lovely lady joined her palms and, raising her lotus-eyes,
spoke thus: “O Divine Ones, I heard the swan and chose
my lord, and by that sincerity which I have kept in all faith
and honour, I call upon your greatness, O Mighty, who for a
while have blinded my eyes, to show my King to me! Appear,
O Protectors of the World, in your proper shape, that
I may do such reverence as mortals owe to Gods; and reveal
him, mortal, but mine own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being thus called upon in the strength of a pure woman,
straightway the Gods, dropping all disguise, disclosed their
beauty. And immediately she knew them; for their sacred
feet touched not the earth but hung a span’s length above it
in the air, and their forms of crystal essence cast no shadow.
No sweat was beaded on their pure, eternal brows, and their
crowns of flowers in radiance cast back the sun’s beams nor
drooped in the heat. And neither wavered their shining
eyes, fixed upon the Princess, nor did the lids flicker, and in
motionless majesty the Immortal Gods stood there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beside them stood Nala, very weary and foredone
with grief and pain. His shadow lay black before him in
the fierce sun, the sweat hung thick upon his brows where
the faded flowers drooped. Beautiful, wearied and mortal,
he stood beside the Immortal Gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Damayanti looked upon those unchanging faces, in
which was neither sorrow nor anger, for they sit above the
thunder; and they regarded her, as it were unseeing, yet seeing
all things, as do the holy images, and in their divine
hearts was no love at all. So she passed them by and hung
the perfumed garland round the bowed neck of her love, and
in her voice of music took him to be her lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he said this: “O Lovely—O Faithful, since before
Gods and men you have chosen me, unworthy, true man will
I be and faith and honour will I keep while the breath is in
my nostrils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So together they worshipped the Four, while all the kings
and princes cried aloud: “<span class='it'>Sadhu!</span>”—“Well done!” For
there was none but rejoiced in the beauty and faithfulness
of these two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Immortal Gods, standing in that presence, gave
lordly gifts to the pair. And Indra, the Cloudy God, gave
this: that, when Nala should perform sacrifice, he should
with mortal eyes see the visible God and behold him unafraid.
And Agni, the Lord of Fire, gave this: that at all
times he would come at the call of Nala. And this is a great
gift. And Varuna, the King of Waters, gave this: that at
the word of Nala of Nishada the waters should rise and fall,
obedient. But Yama, the Lord of Death, gave two gifts;
and of these the first was to walk steadfastly in the ways of
righteousness; and the second (let it not be despised!) was
to be skilful in preparing food. And in after times by
strange chance did this prove a great and goodly gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus was the marrying of Nala, King of Men, with Damayanti,
Pearl of Women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reverence to that Lord of Elephant Trunk to whom obstacles
are as nothing, and to those Four Shining Ones who
showed compassion, their ears being open to the prayer of
purity.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:10em;font-size:1.2em;'>THE HIDDEN ONE</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>THE HIDDEN ONE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(The heroine of this story was a Princess of the great Mogul dynasty
of Emperors in India. She was granddaughter of Shah-Jahan and the
lovely lady of the Taj Mahal, and daughter of the Emperor Aurungzib
whose fanaticism was the ruin of the dynasty. The Princess’s title was
Zeb-un-Nissa—Glory of Women. She was beautiful and was and is a
famous poet in India, writing under the pen-name of Makhfi—the Hidden
One. Her love adventures were such as I relate, though I have taken the
liberty of transferring the fate of one lover to another.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>For her poems, which I quote, I use the charming translations by
J. Duncan Westbrook, who has written a brief memoir of this fascinating
Princess. She was a mystic of the Sufi order and her verses “The Hunter
of the Soul,” which I give, strangely anticipate Francis Thompson’s
“Hound of Heaven”, in their imagery. The poems not specified as hers
are a part of my story.)</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The office of hakim (physician) to the Mogul Emperors
being hereditary in my family from the days of Babar the
conquering Emperor, I was appointed physician to the Padshah
known as Shah-Jahan, and when his Majesty became
a Resident in Paradise (may his tomb be sanctified!) my office
was continued by his Majesty Aurungzib, the Shahinshah,
and rooms were bestowed on me in his palace, and by
his abundant favour the health of the Begams (queens) in
the seclusion of his mahal was placed in the hands of this
suppliant and I came and went freely in my duties and was
enlightened by the rays of his magnanimity. And my name
is Abul Qasim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all that garden of flowers, the Begams and Princesses,
there was one whom my soul loved as a father loves
his child, for she resembled that loveliest of all sweet ladies,
her father’s mother, she who lies buried by Jumna River in
the divine white beauty of the Taj Mahal. (May it be
sanctified to her rest!) In my Princess’s sisters, it is true I
have seen a flash now and again of that lost beauty, but in
her it abode steadfast as a moon that knows no change and
at her birth she received the name of Arjemand after that
beloved lady, whose death clouded the universe so that its
chronogram gives the one word “Grief.” But the child
also received the title of Zeb-un-Nissa—Glory of Women,
and such this resplendent Princess most truly was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And surely the prayer for resemblance was granted by the
bounty of Allah, for she grew into womanhood dark, delicious
as a damask rose, enfolding the hidden heart of its
perfume in velvet leaves, a soft luxuriant beauty that stole
upon the heart like a blossom-bearing breeze and conquered
it insensibly. Of her might it be said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the mole upon thy cheek would I give the cities of
Samarkand and Bokhara,” and a poet of Persia, catching a
glimpse of her as she walked in her garden, cried aloud in an
ecstasy of verse:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“O golden zone that circles the Universe of Beauty,</p>
<p class='line0'>It were little to give the earth itself for what thou circlest.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Yet, this surprising loveliness was the least of her perfections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how shall this suppliant who is but a man describe
the spell of her charm? Allah, when he made man and
laid the world at his feet, resolved that one thing should be
hidden from his understanding, that still for all his knowledge
he should own there is but one Searcher of Secrets.
And the heart of this mystery is woman, and if she be called
the other half of man it is only as the moon reflects the
glory of her lord the sun in brilliance, though (as a wise
Hindu pandit told me for truth) she has a cold and dark
side which is always unknown to him, where alone she revolves
thoughts silent, cold, and dangerous. Therefore to
sift her in her secrecies is a foolhardy thing, and not in vain
is it written by Aflatoun (Plato), the wise man of Greece,
that the unhappy man who surprised a goddess bathing in
the forest was rent in pieces by his own hounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet this feat must be attempted for if there is a thing it
concerns man to know it is the soul of this fair mystery who
moves beside him and surrenders Heaven to him in a first
kiss and the bitterness of the hells in a last embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore I essay the history of this Princess, the Glory of
Women, who was an epitome of her sex in that she was beautiful,
a dreamer, a poet, and on the surface sweet in gentleness
as a summer river kissing its banks in flowing, but beneath——</p>

<p class='pindent'>I write.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing her intelligence clear as a sword of Azerbajan, her
exalted father resolved that his jewel should not be dulled
by lack of polishing and cutting, and he appointed the wise
lady Miyabai to be her first teacher. At the age of seven
she knew the Koran by heart, and in her honour a mighty
feast was made for the army and for the poor. As she grew,
aged and saintly tutors were appointed, from whom she
absorbed Arabic, mathematics and astronomy, as a rose
drinks rain. No subject eluded her swift mind, no toil
wearied her. Verses she wrote with careless ease in the
foreign tongue of Arabia, but hearing from an Arab scholar
that in a single line the exquisite skill betrayed an Indian
idiom, she discarded it instantly because she would have perfection
and wrote henceforward in her own tongue—Persian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No pains were spared upon this jewel, for the Emperor
desired that its radiance should be splendid throughout Asia,
yet her limit was drawn, and sharply. For in her young
pride of learning she began a commentary on the holy Koran,
and hearing this, he sternly forbade it. A woman might
do much in her own sphere, he wrote, but such a creature
of dust may not handle the Divine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, Abul Qasim, was with her when the imperial order
reached her and saw her take the fair manuscript and obediently
tear it across, desiring that the rent leaves be offered
to the Shadow of God in token of obedience. But those
dark and dangerous eyes of hers were not obedient beneath
the veiling of silken lashes, and turning to me, to whom she
told her royal heart, she said;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hand may not write the heart may think, and in
the heart is no Emperor. It is free,” and leaning from the
marble casement she looked down into the gliding river and
said no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the Emperor made amends, and noble, as far as his
light led him. Not for a woman the mysteries of the faith
of Islam that he held of all things the greatest, but, fired
by the praises of her tutors, he sent throughout India, Persia
and Kashmir for poets worthy of this poet-Princess and
bid them come to Delhi and Agra and there dwell that a fitting
company be made for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, veiled like the moon in clouds, curtained and attended,
the Princess Arjemand was permitted to be present at tournaments
in the palace where the weapons were the wit and
beauty of words, when quotations and questions were flung
about as it might be handsful of stars, and a line given
be capped with some perfect finish of the moment’s prompting
and become a couplet unsurpassable, and very often it
was the soft voice from behind the golden veil that capped
the wisest and completed the most exquisite, and recited
verses that brought exclamations from the assembled poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even Saadi (may Allah enlighten him!) nor Jalalu’d-din
Rumi (may his eyes be gladdened in Paradise) excelled
this lady in the perfumed honey of their words.” So with
one voice they cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was not homage to the daughter of the Protector
of the Universe. No indeed! for death has not washed out
her name with the cold waters of oblivion and now that she
is no more beautiful nor daughter of the Emperor her verse
is still repeated where the poets and saints meet in concourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be seen that her life in the Begam Mahal (the Palace
of the Queens) must needs be lonely, for there was none
among the princesses who shared her pleasures, and their
recreation in languidly watching the dancers or buying jewels
and embroideries and devouring sweetmeats wearied her as
sorely. But she had one friend, Imami, daughter of Arshad
Beg Khan, and this creature of mortality who writes these
words was also accounted her friend though unworthy to be
the ground whereon she set her little foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day did the Lady Arjemand with Imami write
and study, and the librarians of the Emperor had little peace
because of the demand of these ladies for the glorious manuscripts
and books collected by her ancestors from all parts
of the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat and the walls echoed to the low note of her voice
as she read and recited and so beautiful were the tones of
my Princess that I have seen the water stand in the eyes of
those who heard her recite her own verses or those of the
great Persians. It was a noble instrument ranging from the
deepest notes of passion to the keen cry of despair, and I
would listen unwearied while the day trod its blossomed way
from dawn to sunset in the Palace gardens. Great and wonderful
was this new palace of the Emperor with tall lilies inlaid
in the pure marble in stones so precious that they might
have been the bosom adornments of some lesser beauty.
Palms in great vases brought by the merchants of Cathay
made a green shade and coolness for two fountains—the
one of the pure waters of the canal, the other of rose-water,
and they plashed beside a miniature lake of fretted marble
rocks sunk in the floor where white lotuses slept in the twilight
of the calm retreat. Such was the chamber of the
daughter of the Padshah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all the jewels the Princess was the glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely with small pains may the Great Mogul’s daughter
be a beauty, but had she been sold naked in the common
market-place this lady had brought a royal price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toorki and Persian and Indian blood mingled in her and
each gave of its best. The silken dark hair braided about
her head was an imperial crown. From the well-beloved
lady who lies in the Taj Mahal (may Allah make fragrant
her memory), she had received eyes whose glance of slow
sweetness no man, not even the men of her own blood (excepting
only her stern father), could resist, and of her rose-red
lips half sensuous, half child-like, might it be said</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The imperial Mogul women were indeed the jewels of the
world, because the beauties of Asia were chosen to be their
mothers. The net of the Emperors swept wide, and I, who
in virtue of my age and faithful service have seen, testify
that there was none like them, and the loveliest of all was
fit but to serve my Princess kneeling. Shall not the truth
be told? Of the soul within that delicious shrine her deeds
must tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as I have written she sat with Imami by the little
lake, and I in a marble recess by one of the great latticed
windows that looks down on Jumna river and on the other
side over the city of Shahjahanabad, new and luminous in
magnificence. In all the world else are no such palace and
city. At this moment she read aloud a letter from her
father Aurungzib concerning the memoirs of her ancestor the
Emperor Babar who founded their dynasty in India, a book
written by his own hand and religiously preserved in the
Mogul archives, and she read it with anger because when
she demanded this book from the librarian, the Padshah
hearing wrote thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy Daughter of Sovereignty. There is one manner
of life for men, who are the rulers, and for women, who are
the slaves. It seems you go too far. What has a daughter
of our House to do with our ancestor Zah-r-ud-din Muhammed
Babar, the resident in Paradise? I have granted much
already. Plant not the herb of regret in the garden of affection.
He writes as a man for men. The request is refused.
Recall the verse of the poet:</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘Ride slowly and humbly, and not in hurrying pride</p>
<p class='line0'>For o’er the dusty bones of men, the creature of dust must ride.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“What an Emperor writes is not suitable for the Princesses
of his House. His duty is rule; theirs, obedience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a discouragement but a command, and another had
laid the finger of obedience on the lips of silence, but, taking
counsel with her heart, this Princess did not so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called to me for her pen and wrote in answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted Emperor, Shahinshah, Shadow of God, King of
the world, Refuge of the needy, father of the body of this
creature of mortality, be pleased to hear this ignorant one’s
supplication. Surely you have fed my mind on the bee’s-bread
of wisdom, and from your own royal lips have I learnt
that the words of our ancestor (upon whom be the Peace!)
are full of flavour and laughter, generous and kind, shining
with honour and the valour of our family. Now, since this
is the root whence sprang your auspicious Majesty’s rule,
should not a humble daughter triumph in it? True is it
that I am your female slave, yet may this worthless body
bear one day a son to transmit your likeness to the prostrate
ages, and since we do not breed lions from lambs, his
mother should carry the laughter and fire of her race like a
jewel in the mine of her soul. I make my petition to the
Padshah, the holiest of Emperors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be granted me,” said the Princess reading these
letters aloud to Imami and to me, “because of that last word—the
holiest. He values that title more than to be called
the Shahinshah. And with all my heart I would it were
otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why, high Lady?” cried Imami in sheer astonishment.
“Surely the Padshah is a saint and his deeds and
words will shine in Paradise. It is blessed to be devout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know little of Paradise, but I know, and my father
might know if he studied the life of Akbar the Great, his
great-grandfather, that to be so bitter a saint in our Mohammedan
faith that he insults and persecutes every other
is to break our dynasty to powder. Consider of it, Imami,
as I do. Have you read the Acts of Akbar Padshah the
greatest sovereign that ever reigned? Were I emperor in
India thus and thus I would do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glory of Women, may your condescension increase!
What did Akbar Padshah?” said Imami, joining her hands,
but I said nothing because I knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though he was born Moslem yet he honoured all the
Faiths, knowing in his wisdom that the music is One and
the dogmas but the foolish words that man in his ignorance
sets to it. All faiths are true, and none!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood almost fell from my face as I heard her, because
had these words been carried to the Emperor not even
her rank, not even her daughterhood, could have saved the
Princess. With Imami and me she was safe, but in a palace
a bird of the air may carry the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” she went on, laughing coldly, “Akbar Padshah
had in all ways the tastes of Solomon the Wise and his Begam
Mahal (Palace of the Queens) was a garden of beauty.
But observe! The Queens were chosen from every faith
and each had the right to worship as she would. There were
Indian princesses who adored Shiva the Great God and
Krishna the Beloved. There was the Fair Persian who worshipped
the Fire as Zoroaster taught, and there were ladies
of the faith of our Prophet more than can be counted.
Whereas in the zenana of my imperial father——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused, and Imami continued with gravity that concealed
a smile:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Begams recite the holy Koran all day, as becomes
the ladies of the Emperor who says that he sighs for the life
of a faquir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And would he had it!” cried the Princess with passion,
“for every day discontent grows among the Hindus that are
taxed, beaten, and despised only because they hold the faith
of their fathers. Is there one of them employed about the
court or in the great offices? Not any. Whereas the Emperor
Akbar in his deep wisdom made them as one with ourselves
and thus built up a mighty Empire that my father
with holy hands destroys daily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Brilliant Lady, for the sake of the Prophet, be silent!”
I said, for indeed she terrified me by her insight. It is better
for a woman that she should not know, or, knowing, keep
silence. “If these words were carried to the Padshah——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should at the least be imprisoned and never more see
the light of day— Well, one may be a devotee out of the
Faith as in it, and like Akbar Padshah, I am the devotee of
Truth who shuts her fair eyes on no faith that men hold
in humbleness of heart. And were it policy only, is it not
madness to disgust and terrify the countless millions of the
Hindus upon whom our throne is carried? The end is
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the end?” asked Imami in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Misery for himself—though that matters little, for he
will take it as the robe of martyrdom from the hand of Allah,
but ruin for the Mogul Empire in India. O that I were
a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face lit up into such pride and valour as she spoke
that I wished it also, for I knew that her words were true as
truth. But in India a woman can do nothing. It is little
wonder I trembled for my Princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A picture of her Imperial father lay on the low table at
her elbow, painted by a Persian artist of fame, and beautiful
as a jewel in its small brilliant colours, and looking upon it
one might see the Kismet of the Emperor in every feature.
Eyes stern but sad, the narrow brows and close lips of the
man who sees not life as it is but as his own thought of it,
bounded by those high narrow brows that overweighted the
lower part. The head of the Emperor was surrounded like
that of a saint with a golden halo and his stern eyes were
fixed on some vision invisible to others. The jaw was weak
but fine, and of all dangerous things on earth beware the
strength of a weak man in the grip of his belief. The Princess
looked at it, and then at me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Emperor (may Allah enlarge his reign) should have
lived in the time of the Prophet and have been the Sword in
his right hand. He is born centuries too late. It is policy
now that carries all before it. O could I speak my mind to
him, for my brothers dare not, but he and I are worlds apart
and in his presence I am silent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sighed. Not his throne, nor his children, nor his women,
nor aught on earth weighed for one grain of sand against
the Pearl of the Faith. True is it that the Emperor Akbar
followed the Vision also but with eyes how wide and clear!—knowing
this for certain, that mortal man <span class='it'>cannot</span> know,
that Truth is a bird flying in the skies and lets fall but a
feather to earth here and there. So he made for himself a
faith that held the quintessence of all the faiths, and had
his sons been like to him—but past is past. They were not,
and they broke his great heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I said, bowing very low:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess, when the happy day comes that you must wed
you shall make your lord Lord of the World with your wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, but bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, I have lovers! For one, Suleiman, my cousin, son
of the brother whom the Emperor slew because he stood too
near the throne. By report I knew what he was, but I saw
him and spoke with him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Princess, and how?” I asked in great surprise, knowing
that his presence in the Begam Mahal would have been
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me with large calm eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My faithful servant, have you come and gone so long
about the Begam Mahal and have not known that all things
are possible? Prince Suleiman was veiled like a woman,
and like a woman he stood where you sit, and I saw his face
and we spoke together. Should not cousins meet who may
be man and wife? And I have loved his father, Prince
Dara, very much, who was learned and good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I trembled again when I heard, for had the Emperor
guessed that she had done this thing what hope for her?
His three brothers had he slaughtered, and the Prince Suleiman
was doomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he saw your face, O Brilliant Lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and not for fear’s sake but because I liked him not at
all. He said ‘O Envy of the Moon, lift up your veil that I
may enjoy the marvel of your beauty’ and I sang this verse
I had made to my lute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught up her lute that lay beside her and sang,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I will not lift my Veil,</p>
<p class='line0'>For if I did, who knows?</p>
<p class='line0'>The bulbul might forget the rose,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Brahman worshipper</p>
<p class='line0'>Adoring Lakshmi’s grace</p>
<p class='line0'>Might turn, forsaking her,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To see my face;</p>

<p class='line0'>Think how within the flower</p>
<p class='line0'>Hidden as in a bower</p>

<p class='line0'>And none can look on it.</p>
<p class='line0'>So me the world shall see</p>
<p class='line0'>Only within the verses I have writ.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I will not lift the Veil.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“And the fool caught me and would have torn it,” she
added, “but Imami restrained him, and he flung from us like
a woman in temper as in dress. A contemptible creature!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Lady of Beauty, what had you against him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I not know all that goes on in this city? Do I not
know that Prince Suleiman spends his days and nights in
Shaitanpur (Devilsville, the quarter of pleasure) and was
I to show my face to a man reeking from the embraces of the
bazaar? No, I am Makhfi (the Hidden One) and hidden I
will remain for such as he. I will be no rival to Peri Mahal
the dancer and her like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as she ended a low voice at the curtain that
veiled the entrance asked for admission and when she granted
it, the heavy silk was drawn aside and a tall veiled woman
entered. The Princess did not look up but I saw Imami’s
eyes fix as if startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her slave prays for a word with the Marvel of the Age
whose mind is so lovely that it outshines even her fair face
and her face so beautiful, that it is the lamp that permits the
light of her soul to shine through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Warm for a woman!” said the Princess, and looked
straight at the new-comer who stood salaaming with the
utmost humility. She added impatiently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need of this ceremony, lady. Remove your
veil. The good physician Abul Qasim is privileged to see
the faces of all in the Begam Mahal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a flash the veil was torn off and a man’s face appeared
beneath it—young, bold, and handsome with the high features
of the Imperial House, a splendid dissolute young man
with the down black on his upper lip like the black astride
the young swan’s bill. Prince Suleiman, the son of Dara
the Emperor’s brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, daughter of my uncle!” he cried,— “Did I not wager,
did I not swear, that I would see that hidden beauty
and now I see it face to face. Poets have sung it and painters
praised it, but their words and their colours were lies for
they could not utter the truth. And having seen I entreat
for my father’s sake, for love’s sake, that it may be mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made towards her eagerly, wholly disregarding Imami
and me. I looked to see her confused or angry, but she
spoke with a most misleading calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted cousin, you have won your wager and your
bride. If her embrace is cold it is at least constant and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cold, with those burning lips of rose, those glowing eyes?
O Loveliest, Divinest, grant me one kiss for earnest if you
would not have me die at your feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw her sign with her hand to Imami who glided away,
flattening herself against the wall as if terrified, then she
spoke serenely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted cousin, when were you last in Shaitanpur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It stopped him like a lightning flash. He stood arrested
on the marble before her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing of Shaitanpur,” he said, breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Nor of the dancer Peri Mahal and her house with
the courtyard of roses, nor of the song she sings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she caught up her lute and sang in a low voice,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>Tear the leaves of the rose apart.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He stared, his eyes slowly dilating. That the daughter
of the Emperor should sing the song of the bazaar—the song
of the light women—! Then it emboldened him. He
threw himself forward to seize her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maker of verses, this is a rose of your own garden. Till
now I never heard it, but it speaks of love. You shall not
ask me twice. My rose, my pearl, my star!—” He caught
the hem of her veil. Now I knew well from her eyes that
he rushed on his fate, but it was written in the book of his
destiny and what is written who can avert?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew back a little and looked at him with soft eyes—wells
of delicious darkness, the swelling curves of her
lovely form a temptation for true believers, and her lips
smiling a little as if from delight at their own sweetness.
And indeed her voice was gentle as moonbeams and as caressing,
as though she could sacrifice all to please the man
whom she exalted with the sight of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortunate cousin, I am a weak woman. How dare I
face the wrath of the Emperor? He did not love your father.
He does not love your father’s son, yet if he did——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drooped her head a little as if with a soft shame that
overwhelmed her in the depths of modesty. O very woman,
divine yet a child!— She had turned wisdom into folly
with a glance. And he trembling, and with eyes fixed,
stammered out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, I have dreamed of your sweetness and what is the
dream to the truth? I am drowned in it. O give it to
me; make it mine that in life and death it may enfold me and
that I may never again behold a lesser light, having seen
the ineffable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he caught her hand passionately and drew her towards
him, she yielding gently and slowly, resisting a very
little, and looking at him as if with compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And very softly in a voice like the breathing of a flute she
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my cousin, how should we face the wrath of the Emperor?”
as though all her soul were in that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he, kissing her hands with frenzy, said in broken
words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Moon of my delight that knows no wane, let me but
watch with you through the starry hours of one night, and
then, then if the Padshah’s will be to slay me, I shall at least
have lived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I also,” she said, looking down like the feminine
incarnation of modesty, so that enraptured he flung his arms
about the yielding softness of her most exquisite form and
kissed her on the lips as a thirsty man in the desert grasps
the cup nor can sever his mouth from it. And when he
would permit her to speak she leaned her head backward to
gain space, and she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is my lord’s will with his slave? And in what
shall I obey him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I, standing in the recess would have warned him, if
I could, that not thus—O not thus, does the proudest and
wisest of women abandon herself to such as he! For I had
pity on his youth and the manly beauty of him, and the
Imperial blood that he shared with her. But who was this
creature of dust to obstruct the design of the Imperial Princess?
And indeed even I wavered and was uncertain that
I guessed her meaning, with such veiled submissive sweetness
did she hold his hand in hers and touch it to her lovely
brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And trembling like a man in a fever, he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O darling little slave, since you give me the right to command
what is wholly mine, I say this— Let my slave, whose
slave I am, expect me to-night when the moonlight touches
the western corner of the Divan-i-Am, and I will come to
this chamber of bliss, and my life, my soul, are in the hand
of my slave whose feet I kiss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And throwing himself on the marble like a worshipper he
kissed the flower-soft feet that showed like bare gold beneath
the hem of her robe, and so rising to his knee, looked
up at her as an idolater at the goddess vouchsafed to his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she looked beyond him at the curtain that veiled the
door. It lifted to a hidden hand, and Imami stood there,
ash-pale, in her hand a dish of gold, and standing upon it a
great goblet of jewelled glass with pomegranate sherbet
brimming in it rose-red and rose-petals floating on the surface
and beside it two cups of gold flashing with diamond
sparks, and on her knee she offered it to the Princess, who
took the goblet and a cup smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortunate cousin, since this is so, and I, my father’s best-beloved
child, will petition him to grant me my heart’s desire,
let us drink the cup of betrothal in the presence of the Hakim
Abul Qasim and the lady Imami. Heart of my heart,
I pledge you!” and setting the blossom of her lips to the
jewelled rim she drank, and filled the other cup for him, and
still kneeling before her breathless with adoration, he took
the cup in both his hands, and I watched and could say no
word because her purpose was clear to me and I knew well
that of all women on earth she was the last to endure the
insult of his presence. And Imami knelt by the door,—her
face like ivory against the heavy gold curtain. Now, as he
set his lips to the cup, suddenly Imami sprang to her feet
and tottered back against the sculptured marble and with
scarce breath to fill her voice——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Emperor comes,” she said, and fell again on her
knees at the door, hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw the sickening terror that struck the colour from the
cheeks and lips of the lover. He knelt there with a glassy
countenance like a man in the clutch of a nightmare who
cannot flee from the advancing doom—his limbs weighted
with lead, his heart with the pressure of an exceeding horror.
But Glory of Women caught him by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted cousin, there is but one way from these rooms,
and the Emperor closes it. Fly to the room beyond my
bed-chamber, the room of the marble bath, and hide where
you can while I hold him in talk. Allah hafiz! (God protect
you!) Go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she pushed him from her, and he fled. Then, most
singular to see, she composed her veil, glancing in the mirror
set in silver that was the gift of the Portuguese priests,
and turned to the door, and as she did so the curtain was
lifted and Aurungzib Padshah entered and Imami prostrated
herself and I also, but the Princess Arjemand knelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I know not how this should be, but in a room where
great events have just happened it is as if the waves of passion
beat about the walls and waft the garments of those
who have been present, and it seemed to my guilty heart as
though the very flowers enamelled on the marble cried
aloud,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Majesty, there is a man—a man in hiding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And certainly the Padshah halted and looked with suspicion
from one to the other of us. He was ever a man of suspicion,
unlike the easy humour of his father Shah-Jahan, and
the half drunken good-nature (shot with frightful angers) of
his grandfather Jahangir. Aurungzib Padshah was a small
man, dark exceedingly, with veiled eyes and shut lips, and
never have I seen him warmed by any emotion of love, pity,
fear, but always calm, cold, self-collected and austere. For
it is well known that his only care was religion, and to this
he sacrificed his all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So looking hard at the kneeling Glory of Women he said
coldly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of the most beneficent and merciful God,
what is this disturbance? Speak, exalted daughter, Princess
of the family of chastity. It is revealed to this suppliant
at the throne of Allah that there is a hidden thing in
these chambers. Speak. What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And kneeling, my Princess answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May joy attend my exalted father, the adorner of the
gardens of happiness, the decorator of the rose-parterre of
enjoyment! There is but one hidden thing in these chambers,
and it is your unworthy daughter, who is known by
your august favour as Makhfi, the Hidden One.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw the eyes of the Padshah fix on the golden dish that
lay on the marble with one cup emptied of the pomegranate
sherbet and the other half emptied, the sherbet running in a
red stream like blood along the marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was set down in haste!” he said through clipped
lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In haste, O Glory of Allah!” said the Princess with the
wet beads clamming the silken tendrils on her forehead.
“I drank and was about to drink the second when your
auspicious feet blessed the threshold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are thirsty, happy daughter of sovereignty? Then
drink the remainder. You have my permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw the gleam in either black eye of him as he spoke,
watching her sidelong. She lifted the cup to her lips with
a hand that shook so that it rattled against her teeth, though
she struggled to command herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, do not drink, royal daughter. It is stale,” he said,
still standing and smiling coldly. And the Princess answered
with quivering lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will not the Mirror of God be seated and partake of refreshment
offered by the hand of his slave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not of that cup and not until I have observed your
embroideries and manuscripts, daughter of high dignity,”
the Padshah replied, and followed by my Princess, Imami
still kneeling by the door, and I by the latticed marble window
he walked about the hall and into the chambers beyond,
talking pleasantly to the Princess at his shoulder,
and so returning took his seat on the divan, and she served
sherbets and fruits on a golden dish to his Majesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was later to attend the Am-Khas, the Hall of Audience,
and was attired kingly. His vest was of white and delicately
flowered satin, with heavy silk and gold embroidery.
His cloth-of-gold turban was aigretted with diamonds great
as stars, with a topaz at the base that shone like the sun.
A chain of great pearls hung to his knees, and above all these
jewels was his cold repelling dignity as of a King too great
to be approached even by the favourite child of his pride,
and all the time he sat she knelt before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he spoke as if in meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glory of Women, you have grown into beauty like that
of the Maids of Paradise. Your long lashes need no antimony,
your eyes are winter stars, and in that robe of gulnar
(pomegranate blossom) you appear like that princess
who bewildered the senses of the mighty Suleiman. [I saw
a quiver pass over her features as she bowed her head beneath
the weight of praise.] Does not the rose long for the
nightingale? Does not your heart, exalted daughter, turn
to love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with her eyes on the ground, she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exhibitor of Perfection, my heart is set on far other
matters. If in this land of good fortune I be remembered
as a poet, I ask no more of destiny save that the rank of
the daughter of Emperors be attached to my name for
ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well. Yet marriage must be considered. Fortunate
daughter, have you bathed to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, deadly pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shadow of the benignity of the Creator, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with set lips he called to Imami by the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasten, lady, and light the fire beneath the great vessel
of water in the bathing room of the Begam, and I will remain
in discourse with her until it is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Imami casting a fearful glance on the kneeling
Princess moved slowly to the inner chamber, and it is the
truth that my soul sickened within me, for though I knew
the young man worthless, and the son of a dangerous father,
yet who could bear this without terror of spirit? And the
Emperor, laying aside his awful Majesty, made his presence
sweet as sunshine in the great chamber of marble, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted daughter, it is but seldom we have leisure to
relax, and yet the olfactory of my soul inhales with delight
the ambergris-perfumed breezes of affection and concord,
and daily if it were possible would I enjoy them. Yes, even
when absent—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in my mind to move with my ladies and the living

and we shall then be more together, partaking of the irrigation

<p class='pindent'>“Great father, you promise me a joy to increase health
and exalt happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swayed as she knelt, and leaned against the divan
with closed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exalted father, the perfume of flowers and of the rose-water
fountain have given me a faintness. May I retire
for a moment with the hakim Abul Qasim to my inner
chamber lest I fall at your feet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is granted, Glory of Women, and the lady Imami shall
recite to me your latest verses until you return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came forward making the salutation, and helped the
Princess to rise, she leaning on my aged arm, and the lady
Imami took her place unrolling a manuscript of verses
splendid with Persian illuminations in blue and gold. The
Emperor composed himself to listen with pleasure, for it is
well known that all the sovereigns of that mighty line were
skilled in versifying and just critics of <span class='it'>ghazal</span> and <span class='it'>suja</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as we moved forward, I supporting her, the Princess
breathed in my ear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant his death, but Allah knowing my heart knows
I am innocent of this hideous thing. O Abul Qasim, father
of my soul, is there aid in earth or heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what could I say? Only the Great Physician of the
Hidden Dispensary could assist that unfortunate. And
meanwhile the sweet voice of the lady Imami read aloud the
verses of the Princess.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Deeper than all.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And then we lost the words as we moved into the inner
chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this inner chamber was all of pearl-pure marble, and
in the midst a deeply sunk bath of marble long and wide
and with its walls decorated with lotuses and their leaves,
and a silver pipe led the water to this from a mighty silver
vessel six feet and more in height and of great capacity,
supported on a tripod of sculptured silver, and below it a
place for fire, enclosed and fed with sweet-scented woods and
balls of perfume made of rare gums. And, O Allah most
Merciful, there the lady Imami had kindled fire by command
of the Emperor, and within might be seen the brilliant blue
flame licking up the perfumes and crawling like snakes
about the cedar wood below the vessel. And certainly I
looked that the Princess should do some desperate deed for
the enlargement of the man most miserable hidden within
the vessel, and releasing her I stood like a graven image of
terror, expecting what she would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her hand on the silver, and amid the crackling of
the flames she said in a clear small voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came unsought. You violated the secrecy of the
Hidden One. What then is your duty, exalted cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And from within he spoke in a voice—O Allah, most compassionate,
grant that I may never hear such again!—the
one word:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true. Keep silence if you are my true lover,
for the sake of my honour. For if your voice is heard I am
a dead woman. But I too will be faithful to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On my head and eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And by her command I gave her water to drink and applied
an essence to her nostrils, and we left the room, pulling
the heavy curtains before it, and we returned to where the
Padshah sat with the pale lady Imami reading aloud and he
smiling in calm content. Seeing us return, he motioned my
Princess to a seat on the divan saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would hear your verses of ‘The Lover.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the fate of a lover? It is to be crucified for the
world’s pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And taking the manuscript from the hands of Imami she
read aloud:</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And so read on steadfastly for the space of an hour, until
the Padshah, replete with the sweetness of the melody, rose
from the divan, and said graciously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the tree of hereditary affection watered by this hour
of converse grow in leaf and fruit and overshadow us both
in peace. Go now, exalted daughter, and bathe your angelic
person and rest with a soul sunned in the favour of the
Emperor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went, we attending him to the door of the secluded
chambers, and when we returned, the Princess lay in
a dead faint on the divan, and the fire beneath the great
vessel of silver was red and silent, and within was silence
also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The courage of Babar the gallant and Akbar the greatly
dreaming was not dead in their descendant and thus in a
great self-sacrifice he became a traveller on the road of
non-existence, and I wept for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Court moved to Lahore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after this on my Princess came a change hard to be
told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had despised the Prince alive. For his death she
loved him, and with a poet’s passion and tenderness mingled
with a woman’s. Her sole relief was in solitude, pouring
forth the burning thoughts wherein the phoenix of her
soul was consumed in perfumed flame which will forever
kindle the heart of man to like ecstasies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great Princes sought her, among them Akil Khan, a most
beautiful young man, aglow with courage and splendour.
He had seen her, dreaming on the roof of her pavilion in the
dawn, pensive and lovely, clothed in dawn-colour, her long
hair braided with pearls falling about her, and mad with
love, he sent her this one line, awaiting completion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A vision in crimson appears on the roof of the Palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kneeling, I implored her to give him some solace,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For O, Light of my soul,” said I, “the years drift by
like leaves, and shall this miracle of beauty and of intelligence
clear as diamonds lead its graces to the grave and
leave the world no copy? My Princess, my Princess, have
pity on your youth! True, the high Prince died a hero for
the sake of a lady’s honour, yet remember that until then the
soul of him was at home in Devilsville, and not in the rose-gardens
of Allah. You have mourned him long enough:
awake now to joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she put it gently aside, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soul washed in the lustration of death is pure.
What is Shaitanpur to him now? He has forgotten it.
And shall I who accepted the sacrifice, forget? O, that
I had not failed in courage—that I had died with him!
Give me the paper of Akil Khan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And considering the line he had written—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A vision in crimson appears on the roof of the Palace,”
she wrote beneath it this line completing the couplet:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither supplications nor force nor gold can win her.”
And so returned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, gallant man as he was, this did not stifle his hope,
and knowing that in her garden at Lahore she was building
a noble marble pavilion, he entered the garden one day disguising
his princeliness under the garment of a mason,
carrying his hod on his shoulder, and passed where she stood
apart watching her girls who were playing at chausar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he drew near he whispered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my longing for thee I have become as dust wandering
round the earth,” and she whose soul was fixed as a lonely
star, responded immediately,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If thou hadst become as the wind yet shouldst thou not
touch a tress of my hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was always. An embassage was sent from the
Shah Abbas of Persia entreating her hand for Mirza Farukh
his son, and the Prince came with it, a gallant wooer. She
dared not at once refuse the insistence of her father Aurungzib
Padshah, and consented that he should come to Delhi
that she might judge of his worthiness. And with a glorious
retinue resembling a galaxy of stars he came, and she
feasted the prince in the pleasure-pavilion in her own garden,
and in its marble colonnade with her own fair hand
offered him wine and sweetmeats, but veiled in gold gauze,
so that not one glimpse had he of the hidden eyes. And
exalted with wine and folly he asked for a certain sweetmeat
in words which by a laughing play on words signify—a
kiss!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, to the proudest of women! One moment she
paused and then haughtily,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask for what you desire from the slaves of our kitchen,”
and so went straight to her royal father and told him that
though face and jewels were well enough, the man had the
soul of a groom under his turban of honour, and she would
have none of him. She had her royal way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raging with foiled pride and desire he sent her this
verse,</p>

than the living, and the clutch of a dead hand chills the
blood. She had the soul of a mystic and in her poems
desire for the Eternal Beloved was mingled with love of
him who was now also behind the Veil of non-existence, and
I know not which was more in her thoughts when she wrote
with tears that fall and falling gather,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very strange is the heart of a woman! I, remembering
her scorn for this very Prince and her will to slay him with
her own hand, could not at all commend nor comprehend
her passion for him dead whom living she trod as the dust
beneath her feet. She permitted my speech gently, but
would reply only,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He loved me and gave his life for me.” And I venturing
to rejoin,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But O exalted Lady, men will give their lives for a little
thing, a jewel, a worthless intrigue, the slaying of a tiger,
and is his sacrifice worth such a return as yours?” she replied
with calm; “Greater love hath no man than in silence
to lay down his life uncheered by commendation or
the joy of battle, and to him I swore fidelity. Should I
change? In his death was the high heart that in life would
have grown to glory—and I broke it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is greater love to live for a woman than to die for her
and this he could never have done, for his profligacy and
selfishness would have swept all love to ruin,”—and she,
smiling, put this by, as one who has attained in her own
heart to behold the innermost secrets of love. And which
of us was right I cannot now tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as love rose about her like a tide her thoughts turned
more and more to the Supreme, the Self-Existent,—and this
love also consumed her for He wounded her heart with the
august secrets of His beauty, and perceiving in vision wafts
of His sweetness she sank into a deep melancholy, desiring
that to which no earthly passion may attain. So in this
poem she beheld Him as the Hunter of the Soul:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I have no peace, the quarry I, a Hunter chases me,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It is Thy memory.</p>
<p class='line0'>I turn to flee but fall: for over me He casts His snare,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;His perfumed hair,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who can escape Thy chain? no heart is free</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;From love of Thee.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>So passioning for the Divine she spent her days in longing,
and a great wisdom came upon her, for even as her mighty
father narrowed in vision, persecuting the Hindus, and
breaking the very Empire against the rock of their tortured
faith, so she like the sun at setting illumined all beliefs, even
the lowliest, with her level rays, declaring that where any
prayer is made that place is the mosque and the Kiblah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had that lady been Emperor it is not too much to say
she had saved the Empire. Would to Allah that she had
been. But He knows all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet a better fate was decreed for her for she lived, exhaling
love as the lily its perfume, and departed in a white
peace, a gently fading light like the cresset that for a little
illumines the quiet of a tomb, and this she said in dying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the daughter of a King but I have taken the path
of renunciation, and this shall be my glory, as my title signifies
that I am the Glory of Women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This she is, for in India she is remembered by all who
burn in the fire of love, human or divine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, since she was a woman and therefore a creature of
unreason, must I condemn her passion for the worthless
prince to whom her royal life was dedicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here I set down the last words that Makhfi—the Hidden
One—wrote with her dying hand, and they were these—</p>

glorious garden where her sweet spirit might gladden to
dream in the moonlight, her griefs forgotten, her joys completed
in the ecstasy of union with the One, the Alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the lands that smile upon their lover the sun, surely
the land of Kashmir is the loveliest. All round that Valley
of Beauty the mountains stand like the guardians of a great
Queen. No harsh winds may ruffle the lakes, darkly blue as
the eyes of the goddess Shri, where the lotuses dream above
their mirrored images in amazement at their own divinity,
for the shields of the eternal snows piercing even the heavens
turn aside all tempests and only a sweet and calm sunshine
makes the air milk-warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because the beauty that surrounds them is absorbed
by the princesses of Kashmir until they become like the
slender-waisted beauties of the ancient poems and stories
of India, radiant as the sun, fair as the full moon mirrored
in a lake dreaming of her own beauty, so are they eagerly
sought by all the Kings from North to South, and great
dowries are given for them with jewels piled high like grain
in harvest, and elephants and garments with beaten gold
laid on them such as would dazzle the eyes of the Queens of
other countries. And nothing is too much to give for their
seductive beauties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, at one time the King of Kashmir had a daughter, his
only one,—more exquisite than dawn blushing on the snows.
She had stolen the hue of her eyes from the blue of the lotus
of the hidden lakes, and the delicate shaping of her face was
high craftsmanship of high Gods at the work they love best.
And down to the ankle rolled her midnight hair, braided
and jewelled, and Love’s own honey made her mouth a
world’s wonder of rose and pearl,—and the curves of her
sweet body were rounded as the snowdrifts of Mount Haramoukh
and as pure. And even this was not all, for what
is a flower without scent and beauty without charm? But
grace went beside her like an attendant, and attraction that
none could resist was in her glance, and whoso escaped the
lure of her eyes would assuredly fall a victim to the seduction
of her sweet laughter so that only in the protection of
the Gods was there safety, and it is known that even the
Gods cease their vigilance where a beautiful woman is concerned
and forget their divinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this Princess Amra loved above all things the gardens
of her royal father, and it was her custom, forsaking
the Palace, to come for days with her women to the gardens
by the lake, dwelling in the Pavilion of the Painted Flowers
and passing the days in singing and feasting, wandering beneath
the shade of the mighty chinar trees and breathing the
perfume of flowers and the coolness of the high snows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So on a certain day she and her ladies wandered through
the roses in beauty so exquisite that the flowers swayed to
behold them and the very waters of the cascades delayed
to kiss their feet, and as they did this there came a message
from the King her father that he had betrothed her to marry
the King of Jamu, and the marriage would take place in the
marriage month according to the auspicious calculations of
the astrologers. And hearing this, the Princess stopped in
terror beside the water that falls over the ripple of cut marble,
and she said to her women:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O sorrowful day! O fears that beset my heart! I who
have never seen any man save my auspicious father and
brothers and the old grey-beard, the Pundit Ram Lal,—what
a fate is this! What do I know of men? How shall
I learn? O, my misery!”—and she sat herself beneath the
shade of a great chinar tree, and became inconsolable, weeping
bitterly, and her women wept with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So passed an hour, and at last her confidante, Lailela, a
girl from Bokhara, having dried her eyes began to look
about her, and she saw that with the written command of
the King had come a small object folded in rose silk and
bound with threads of gold, and with the insatiable curiosity
of a woman she said to the weeping Princess:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Lady, here is a something—I do not know what,
but I guess it to be a bridal gift from his Majesty.” And the
Princess took it in her hands and her ladies gathered about
her as stars surround the moon, and with her slender fingers
and nails like little pearls she unthreaded the knots of gold
and the inner treasure was disclosed, and it was a frame of
gold filagreed and set with rubies and diamond sparks, and
within it the portrait of a young man, and written on the
back of it: “The King of Jamu.” The artist, whose skill
resembled that of the Creator, had depicted him seated on
his throne of ivory inlaid with gold, and in his turban blazed
that great jewel known as the Sea of Splendour, but these
did not for one moment detain the eye, for he was himself
the jewel of Kings, young, noble, dark of hair and eyes, with
amorous lips, proud yet gentle, and a throat like the column
that upholds the world, and limbs shaped for height and
strength and speed. And surely had he been a water-carrier,
men had said, “This is the son of a King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the Princess Amra looked she sighed and changed
colour, and the last tear fell from her long lashes upon the
portrait, and she dried it with her gold-bordered veil, and
looked and sighed again, and lost in thought she fell into a
deep silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Lailela said with sympathy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely a terrible doom, O Princess! Now had the King
been an old man, kind and paternal, it would but have been
passing from the arms of one father to another. But a
young man— O, there is much to fear, and who shall sound
the deeps of their hearts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Princess slowly shook her head, not knowing
what she did, still gazing at the portrait, and Lailela continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little do we all know men. But I have been told it is
safer to adventure in a jungle of tigers than to take a husband
knowing nothing of their wiles and tyrannies, and it
is now my counsel that we should all declare before the
Princess any small knowledge that has reached us, that she
may not go forth utterly unarmed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the ladies looked doubtfully at one another, and
the Princess smiled faintly as a moon in clouds, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sisters, it is my command that you do as Lailela has said,
for her counsel is good, and she herself shall begin, for I
perceive there is knowledge behind her lips. Let all now
prepare to listen, for we speak of love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she laid the portrait on her knees, and Lailela with
laughter in her long eyes but a great gravity of speech, told
this story:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Princess, this is one of the parables that the Sheikh
Ibrahim related to his daughter, the Lady Budoor, that she
might be admonished. For the damsel was the temptation
of the Age, with heavy hips, and brows like the new moon,
and a mouth like the seal of Suleiman, so that the reason of
whoso saw her was captivated by her elegance. But she
spoke little, or of trivial matters, and smiled not at all, relying
on her beauty, which, indeed, was the perfection of the
Creator’s handiwork. May his name be exalted! And her
father accosted her, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Know, O daughter, that Shah Salim had five thousand
wives and concubines of perfect loveliness, with languishing
looks, high-bosomed, and of equal age, a delight to beholders
such as astonished the mind. But the King was wearied
because of the dullness of their society and it so befell that
he yawned repeatedly and his jaw became fixed with the
violence of his yawns, nor could the art of the <span class='it'>hakims</span> unloose
it. And the Queens and the concubines slapped their
faces for grief, and the Emirs trembled because of the case
of the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now it chanced that the King of Seljuk sent unto Shah
Salim a slave girl from Tabriz, and the merchant who conducted
her bore this message, written on ivory, bound with
floss silk, and perfumed with ambergris: “Know, O King of
the Age, that the perfume is not to be judged by the jar, nor
the jewel by its weight, for the perfume is the soul of the
rose, and the secret of the jewel is its fire. Receive, therefore
this gift according to the measure of thy wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But the Shah-in-Shah, speaking with difficulty, for his
jaw was held as in a vise, commanded, saying; “Enclose her
with the Queens and the concubines, for they have brought
me to this, and the sum of my wisdom and experience is
that they are all alike, and whoso knows one, knows all.
Yet, first let me behold her, since she is the gift of a King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And they unveiled the damsel, and behold! she was slender
as a willow branch, low-bosomed, green-eyed, and her
hair was like beaten bronze, nor could she for beauty compare
with the wives of the King, so that the beholders marvelled
at the gift of the King of Seljuk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And she looked upon the King, and, seeing his case, she
closed her eyes until they shone like slits of emerald and
laughed aloud until the Hall of Requests echoed with her
laughter, and her voice was like the flute and such as would
bewilder the reason of the sages and cause the ascetic to
stumble in his righteousness, and she could narrate stories
like those of the Sultana Shahrazad (upon whom be the
Peace!), and her effrontery was as the effrontery of the
donkey-boys of Damascus. For there is none greater.
Nor did she fear the Shah-in-Shah before whom all abased
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So she seated herself before the Wonder of the Age, and,
casting down her eyes, the damsel related to him the true
story of the Adventure of the Lady Amine and the Sage El
Kooz. And the heart of the Shah was dilated and he laughed
until there was no strength left in him, and the <span class='it'>hakims</span>
thumped his back, fearing that life itself would depart from
him in the violence of his laughter. And his jaw instantly
relaxed. So being recovered, he commanded saying:
“Bring hither the artificers of gold and let them make a chain
that shall bind the waist of this slave to my wrist, for where
I go she shall go, that my soul may be comforted by her
narratives and the sweetness of her laughter. For this truly
is a gift worthy of a king. But place guards at the doors
of the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And after consideration and counsel with his Wazir he
bestowed upon the Queens great gifts and returned them to
their parents. And there was a great calm. And he became
distracted with love for this slave and they continued
in prosperity and affection until visited by the Terminator
of Delights and Separator of Companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Extolled be He whom the vicissitudes of time change not
and who is alone distinguished by the attributes of Perfection!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now this is a parable, my daughter, of the secrets of the
hearts of men, and I will relate others that thou mayest be
admonished.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Lady Budoor answered modestly: ‘Speak on,
my father, I listen.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Lailela had finished this story she resumed her
seat, and the ladies reflected deeply, and the Princess said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This must undoubtedly be true. As a man no longer observes
an object which he sees daily, so must it be with a
man and the beauty of his wife. Clearly it is not enough
to be beautiful even as a Dancer of Heaven. It is also needful
to be a provoker of laughter. Would that I knew the
stories of this slave .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sisters, have they been heard by
any of you? What is beauty, when the beautiful are forsaken
or die? But tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Vasuki, a lady of the Rajputs, stepped forward
in all the insolence of beauty, swaying her hips, and rearing
her head like a Queen as she came, and she began thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess, of my heart, let none tempt you to undervalue
the gift of loveliness by which even the greatest of the
Gods are subjected as my story will declare. And let it be
remembered that if even a man weary of his wife’s beauty—there
are yet other men in the world, and what though our
faith forbid marriage there are other faiths. And, if this
be impossible, a woman can always be captured if so she
will! And I would have you recall the story of the Rani
of Mundore who being left a widow was captured by a great
King and ruled him and his Kingdom. But hear my story
of why Brahma, a high God of my people, has four faces in
his temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the ancient days in India two evil and terrible brothers
rose to kingly power. They were inseparable as the
Twin Stars, the Aswins, and together they did evil mightily
and in their union was their strength. Finally they formed
plans to storm the lower heavens and expel the Gods and
there was every reason to believe they would carry out this
determination. So the Gods held a great Panchayet (council)
and some said one thing, some another, and at last
Brahma the Creator spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Great Gods and Heavenly Ladies, in the union of these
wretches is their power, because where two perfectly agree
their wisdom is unconquerable. It is only because this has
never been the case on earth that we are able to keep any
sort of order. Now of all influences the most powerful is
love. True it is their palaces are full to over-flowing with
handsome women but we are still the Gods, the makers of
men. Let us take for our model the Goddess of Beauty herself,
and send some exquisite one on earth to distract and divide
the evil kings.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the flowers of heaven were brought, and the Goddess
of Beauty stood unveiled and divine before them, and from
the ivory of the lotus blossom they made a sweet body, and
from the dark blue lotus they made two dreaming eyes, and
they took the storm cloud for the glooms of her heavy lashes,
and the midnight deeps for the lengths of her silken hair,
and for her smile they took the sunshine and for her blush
the dawn, and for her coquetry the playfulness of the kitten,
and for her seductions the wiles of the serpent, and for
her fidelity—but all their materials were exhausted before
the necessity for this was remembered. And Lakshimi gave
her instead what is invisible but omnipotent, her own charm
which none has ever seen but all the Universe has felt. And
when all was done great Brahma breathed life into the fair
image and she arose and looked down upon her own beauty
with astonishment and in a voice of crystal music she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am Tillotama.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all the Gods stood confounded at their own handiwork
but the Goddesses turned angrily away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they commanded her to go to earth and instructed her,
each mighty heart beating with agony that she should go.
And she passed before the Throne of Brahma making a
<span class='it'>pradakshina</span>, a reverential threefold circuit, about him keeping
him always to the right. And he gazed passionately upon
her and she made a turn to the left, and for pride he would
not turn his head, but from the energy of his soul’s longing
another face sprang out on the left side of his head and the
eyes still followed her, and as she made her circuit this again
happened at the back and still he regarded her, and at the
right side also, so that wherever that loveliness went his
eyes fed upon her with more passion than the moon-bird
who steadfastly regards the moon all night. And, Princess,
this is the undoubted reason why the image of Brahma has
ever since had four faces. So she went to earth with ruin
for her dower, and the two evil kings desired her and slew
one another for her possession. And Saraswati, the wife of
Brahma, immediately demanded that their work should be
undone and the fair creature resolved again into the elements
of nature lest the peace of heaven should be broken.
So it was done, but Brahma retains forever his four faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore, Princess, if beauty thus subjugates the greatest
of the Gods, what will be the effect of such beauty as
your own upon the heart of the King of Jamu?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Amra clasping her hands, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is a terrible story! For if the greatest of the
Gods, who has a glorious Goddess for his wife, be not faithful,
what hope is in men? I grow so terrified that death
itself seems preferable to marriage. Is there no comfort
in any of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, treading delicately on little bound feet, came
Ying-ning, the fair Chinese maiden from Liang, who had
been presented to the Princess because of her skill in embroidery
and cosmetics. And she saluted humbly, and requested
permission to speak:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess, a great lady has last spoken and who am I?
Yet because I tremble to hear her speak of any other than
a husband in the love of a woman, hear me, for of all dangers
the greatest is the jealousy of a husband. And this is
a true story of my country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a very great artificer long, long years ago and
he made an image exactly resembling a man. It was composed
of wood and glue and leather, and sinews of catgut,
and so great was his skill that he made even a heart that beat
and set it in the breast, and the features were exquisitely
painted and it resembled a great Chinese lord, noble and
handsome and able to sing, move, and talk. Finally he
showed it to the King of Liang who was struck dumb at such
handiwork, for it was like the power of the Immortals. And
he said; ‘My Household must certainly view this marvel,
and there can be no objection to this course of conduct since
I have satisfied myself it is but a thing of springs and
leather.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, on the following day, the artificer brought his image
to the Pepper Chambers, being himself an aged man and in
circumstances which permitted his entry. Being introduced
to the presence of the King, the Queen and the ladies who
rejoiced in the King’s favour, these ladies all stared with
the utmost bewilderment at the handsome young man thus
represented. The artificer touched its chin and it burst into
a love-song most delicately sung in a mellow and manly
voice. It recited a passage from the poets in praise of wine.
It kow-towed before the King. But unluckily, encouraged
by success, the artificer touched its heart, and with the utmost
audacity it gazed upon the ladies and winking one eye,
seized the hand of the loveliest, and placed a sacrilegious
arm about her person, she smiling. A frenzy of passion
swept over the King on seeing this. He shouted for the
death of the artificer, and though the aged man in a terror
instantly rent the image apart into a heap of wood and
leather, he could not be appeased and the unfortunate was
led out and beheaded. Furthermore, he ordered the lady
who had been thus polluted to be instantly strangled because
she had not shrieked on the instant as (he asserted) any
virtuous woman, a stranger to such a contact, must have
done. And in spite of her piteous entreaties she was slaughtered.
Was this reasonable, O my Princess? But be it
known to you that in love and in possession also there is no
reason, and that this is the manner in which all men would
act. And moreover it is their right, and it is entirely just
that even the looks or dreams of a woman should be faithful
to her husband and to him only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ying-ning retreated to the circle, and the Princess
wrung her hands and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then is to become of women if they are thus surrendered
to the mercy of the merciless! I will entreat at
my father’s feet that I may live and die a maid. And I
will——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she could not continue for the beating of her heart,
and now the little lovely gesang, Pak, from Phyong-yang in
the Land of the Morning Calm, whence come all the fairest
singing girls, moved trembling forward and spoke in a voice
of silver, but so low that the Princess called upon her to
stand at her feet that she might hear. Enclosed in a great
lotus blossom she had been presented to the Princess that
she might cheer her with strange dances from the Korean
land, and she had clapped her hands for joy when the ivory
petals fell apart disclosing the small dancer crouched within.
But the women of the Morning Calm have few words and
all now leaned forward to hear what this silent one might
say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Lady, near my home by the Green Duck River
lived long ago a Yang-ban (noble) who had a beautiful
daughter named Ha. She had a slender throat on which
was set a face most delicately painted and of exquisite
charm, the lips resembling ripe cherries and the eyes of
liquid brilliance. Many marriage enquiries were made, but
her father finally made the choice of a young Yang-ban of
good position named Won Kiun, and on a day of favourable
omens she was borne to his house and became his wife. For
five years they lived together in harmony nor did he spend
his time without the screened apartments, for she could even
play chess and he could converse with her. But alas! she
bore no child and daily did her anguish increase, for she
could hear his sighs because he had no son to perform the
rites for him when his time should come. Still hoping, she
delayed, but this could not last, and on a certain day she
approached him saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Lord of my Life, may your worthless wife speak?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He gave permission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Five years,’ said Ha, ‘have gone by and I have not fulfilled
my duty. It is certainly the evil destiny of your
worthless wife which has caused this. Therefore I say
thus:—I will sell my pins of jade and buy a concubine for
you. Accede to my humble request.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won Kiun could scarcely hide his astonishment, for
though this was but fulfilling a duty, still it is not common
for a wife to make this offer. But he agreed instantly for
he earnestly desired a son, and after so many years naturally
desired also a change of companionship. Ha therefore made
search and found a girl named A-pao of as much beauty as
the price she could pay would fetch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then that Ha’s sorrows began. She was neglected
by Won Kiun, tormented by A-pao, but enduring in silence
as a wife should, she went about her work with a smile.
But A-pao also failed in her duty for there was no child, and
presently Won Kiun whose health had always been frail,
departed to the ancestral spirits, A-pao shamelessly took
her place in the house of a rich man, and Ha was left a desolate
widow, and the more so because her parents and her
husband’s justly despised her as a barren wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Princess, mark what followed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had placed her husband’s spirit tablet, which contained
his third soul, beside her bed, and before this made
her offerings of bread and wine and prayers for pardon, and
one night when she had wept herself to sleep a strange thing
happened. The tablet moved,—a human figure slowly
emerged from it and stood on the floor, and Ha, with eyes
distended with terror, saw her husband. In the well-remembered
voice he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I have permission from the Junior Board of the Gods of
Hades to visit you as a reward for my filial merit on earth,
and this in spite of your conduct in that very mistaken business
of A-pao. Had <span class='it'>I</span> been consulted she was by no means
the person I should have chosen. Yet I am come to visit
you and shall do so nightly for a month.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The faithful Ha laid her head on his feet and sobbed for
joy. What a reward! How small now did all her many
sacrifices appear!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a month the spirit tablet nightly became her husband,
and on the last day of the month he bid her an eternal farewell,
and the tablet fell to the ground and broke into two
pieces. With tender care she mended it, and set herself to
await the birth of her son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In due time he was born and her cup of joy would have
run over but that the most shocking rumours were spread
by A-pao and her mother-in-law, and it was believed that
she had grossly dishonoured the fragrant memory of her
husband. Vainly she explained the facts. The only result
was that the magistrate, fearing lest he might possibly
destroy a child of miracle, would not himself put it to death,
but commanded it should be flung to the swine. Marvellous
to tell, the swine, instead of devouring it, kept the child
alive by breathing warmth upon it, and it was then that,
starving for food, and broken-hearted, Ha demanded a test
before the assembled people. It is well known that the
children of the spirits cast no shadow, and the child, before
an immense crowd, with his miserable mother watching from
behind a curtain, was brought into the full sunshine and
held up. To the amazement and fear of all, no shadow was
cast on the earth. To set the matter forever at rest the
spirit tablet was then brought out and a little blood drawn
from the tender arm of the child. This was spread on the
tablet inhabited by the father’s spirit and it instantly sank
in and disappeared, though when spread on another, it rolled
off, leaving no mark. Amid loud shouts the child was pronounced
the true heir of the family. Ha was immediately
pardoned by the parents of Won Kiun and taken into their
favour, being permitted to serve them to the end of their
days, which she did with perfect devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Princess will see from this true story the great reward
that humility and patience bring to a good wife. It is not
every husband who returns from the Land of the Dead to
bring joy to one in such a lowly position. And though it
is easy to be seen that it was his own transcendent merits
which occasioned this joyful result, without the patience of
Ha the nobility of her husband and his parents could
scarcely have been rewarded. Therefore the duty of a
woman is submission and where this exists all her follies and
faults may be covered as a rich brocade covers a poor divan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies were silent and the Princess again shook her
head with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a difficult case,” she said, “and in truth each
seems more alarming than the last. It appears that marriage
is a sea of perils great and terrible, and to escape shipwreck
all but impossible. Possibly if Ha had not bought
the concubine—but have none of my ladies a story of man’s
fidelity? Is such a thing unknown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as she spoke a woman with a face like the dusk
of the evening and eyes as its stars in clouds, broke in upon
her words unmannerly but with such power that all turned
to listen, forgetting even the Presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Princess, my beloved, hear now this last story, for
these women have spoken of little things, but I will speak
of great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is known to you that when the King Rama ruled in
Kosala and was thence driven for awhile into the wild woods,
there went with him of her own choice and in utter devotion,
his wife, young and lovely and noble, the Queen Sita. And
when he entreated her to leave him because of the horror of
the great woods and the wild beasts, and the evil spirits and
hunger and poverty, she replied only: ‘How should I stay
in the glorious city when my husband is gone? I count all
evils as blessings when I am with him. Without him life
is death. And if my prayer is refused I will enter the fire
and await him in the Paradise to be.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she followed Rama, clothed in poverty and in the
wood she served him, unfaltering in piety and all wifely duty.
And as the result of this nobility her beauty so grew that
the very Gods, passing on their high errands would pause
for joy to see her perfections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But on a certain day when the King was absent, the evil
King of Lanka stole this Pearl, hoping to set it in his crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess, it is not needful to tell the sorrows of Sita,
the temptations she resisted nor the cruelties that could not
break her pure will. Flawless in strength and brightness
as the very spirit of the diamond was her faith. And when
Rama at last, by the aid of the Gods, conquered the evil-doer,
she sat beneath a tree, in poor array, trembling for
joy to think that her head should lie once more upon her
husband’s breast and her ear be gladdened with his praise
for the fight she had fought alone in sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she stood before him and he sat upon his victorious
throne and thus he spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Lady, my work is done. I have avenged my honour
and the insult put upon me and my foe is broken. But mistake
me not. It was for no love to you that I fought, but to
uphold the dignity of my race. Your presence now hurts
me as light hurts a diseased eye. Another man has seen
your face unveiled. His hand has touched you. You have
dwelt in his palace. You are no wife of mine. Go where
you will. Do what you will. We are parted.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[And the Princess and all the ladies stared with great
eyes to hear what the woman told.]</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this before a great assembly. So, at first the Queen
wept silently, because this shaft pierced her very heart.
Then, drying her tears, she raised her fair head and answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is all my faithful love forgotten? It was hard for a
weak woman to resist supernatural strength. Yet in all
perils of death and shame I have been utterly chaste in soul
and body, and no evil came near me, for in me there was
none to meet it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She paused and the King made no answer. And she
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If man deserts me the High Gods are faithful. Make
ready the funeral pile. I will not live in this shame.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was done;—none daring to look in the King’s face,
and he still silent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So, circling her husband thrice in
farewell reverence, the Queen entered the fire. And even as
the flame lapped her feet, the Great Gods descended in radiant
chariots plumed for the untrodden ways of the air, and
the God of the Fire, who is the Purifier, took her by the hand
and presented her to Rama, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Even as is my white flame purity, so is the purity of
this Queen.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he accepted her from the God’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Princess, would not all the world believe that after this
coming of the Gods this King would have honoured his
Queen? Yet no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knew her pure, but, since others whispered that another
had seen her face, and who could tell?—again he dismissed
her for in him as in all men, pride was mightier
than love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And once more, Sita, standing before him and knowing
this the end, made declaration of her chastity that all might
hear. And suddenly transported beyond the weakness of
a woman, she stood as one divine, perfect in high soul and
nobility, and she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Never has any thought that was not pure and chaste
entered my heart, and as my heart so is my body. This
have I said. And now, I beseech of the Earth, the Great
Goddess, Mother of us all, that she will grant me a refuge,
for I have none other.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as she spoke these words, a very soft air, laden with
coolness and sacred perfumes, stirred among them, and in
the silence there arose from the earth a Throne and upon
it the Mighty Mother of men and Gods, and she raised the
Queen in her arms and set her upon the Throne that all might
see her throned and glorious. And lo! for a moment she
sat majestic, and the assembly hid their faces, and when
they again raised them all was gone and only the common
day was about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the King wept uncomforted knowing that never
again by city or forest might he see that fair face, which being
his own he had cast from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the woman paused, and all the ladies cried that this
was the cruellest story of all, demanding that she be dismissed
from the Presence as an offender. But the Princess
sat submerged in thought, and the woman said softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Princess—my beloved,—the Gods rule. In all life is
sorrow, whether in Kashmir or Jamu. But the Gods abide.
In the hollow of Their hand lay this Queen, and in the darkness
the King’s eyes could not pierce They smiled. Certainly
she leaned on Their might and so walked content and
what could man do to her? Fear not, my Princess. The
Gods abide—whether in Kashmir or Jamu, and the earth is
Their footstool. And this being so the life of a woman is
her own, go where she will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there fell a great silence and she who said this glided
away and was gone. And presently the Princess rose in the
midst of the women like a Queen, and she spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the truth. Fate is fate and love is love, and
what we do is our own, and not the deeds of another. For
that Queen I do not weep, but for the King who was blind
to her glory. It is the valour of men that sends them forth
to war, and it is the valour of women that puts their hearts
in the hand of their husbands. And to me, since I have
seen this portrait all other things are empty, and if he slay
me still will I love him. For it is the High God, who is
worshipped by many names, who has made the woman for
the man and the man for the woman, and He abides unchanging
in Unity and what He does is better than well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she spoke the colours faded on the mountains
and on the lake the evening came with quiet feet.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you take as long to dress as I do,” she said pettishly;
“I call it neither more nor less than poaching when
a man looks so well turned out. And a Poet, too! Well—you
can sit down; I have twenty minutes free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was dressed for a bridge party. Dressed—oh, the
tilt of the hat over her delicate little nose; the shadow it
cast over the liquid eyes, ambushing them, as it were, for
the flash and spring upon the victim! But I was no victim—not
I! I knew my young friend too well. She endured
me more or less gladly. I sat at her feet and learned
the ways of the sex, and turned them into verse, or didn’t,
according to the mood of the minute. I had versified her
more than once. She was a rondeau, a triolet, a trill—nothing
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why mayn’t a poet look respectable as well as another?”
I asked, dropping into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it isn’t in the picture. You were much more
effective, you folks, when you went about with long hair,
and scowled, with a finger on your brows. But never
mind—you’ve given us up and we’ve given you up, so it
doesn’t matter what women think of you any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never said a truer word!” I replied, lighting my
cigarette at hers. “The connection between women and
poetry is clean-cut for the time. As for the future—God
knows! You’re not poetic any more. And it’s deuced hard,
for we made you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. God made us, they say—or Adam—I never
quite made out which.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a divided responsibility, anyhow. For the Serpent
dressed you. He knew his business there—he knew that
beauty unadorned may do well enough in a walled garden
and with only one to see and no one else to look at. But in
the great world, and with competition—no! And you—you
little fools, you’re undoing all his charitable work and undressing
yourselves again. When I was at the dance the
other night I thirsted for the Serpent to take the floor and
hiss you a lecture on your stupidities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pouted: “Stupidities? I’m sure the frocks were
perfectly lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as they went, but they didn’t go nearly far enough
for the Serpent. And believe me, he knows all the tricks
of the trade. He wants mystery—he wants the tremble in
the lips when a man feels—‘I can’t see—I can only guess,
and I guess the Immaculate, the Exquisite—the silent silver
lights and darks undreamed of.’ And you—you go and
strip your backs to the waist and your legs to the knees.
No, believe me, the Dark Continent isn’t large enough; and
when there is nothing left to explore, naturally the explorer
ceases to exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re very impertinent. Look at Inez. Wasn’t
she perfectly lovely? She can wear less than any of us, and
wear it well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t keep my eyes off her, if you mean that. But
not along the Serpent line of thought. It was mathematical.
I was calculating the chances for and against, all the
time—whether that indiscreet rose-leaf in front would hold
on. Whether the leaf at the back would give. At last I
got to counting. She’s laughing—will it last till I get to
five-and-twenty? thirty? And I held on to the switches to
switch off the light if it gave. The suspense was terrific.
Did she hold together after midnight? I left then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t tell you. You don’t deserve to hear,” she said
with dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brief silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by saying you poets made us?” she
began again, pushing the ash-tray toward me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know, as a matter of fact people long ago
didn’t believe you had any souls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t think of contradicting you, my dear Joan,
but it’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the Turks, and heathen like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no—the Church. The Fathers of the Church, met
in solemn council, remarked you had no souls. It was a
long time ago, however.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did. They treated you as pretty dangerous little
animals, with snake’s blood in you. Listen to this:
‘Chrysostom’—a very distinguished saint—‘only interpreted
the general sentiment of the Fathers when he pronounced
woman to be a necessary evil, a natural temptation,
a desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a deadly fascination,
a painted ill.’ You see you had found the way to the rouge-box
even then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder if they were right,” she said, incredibly.
“I’ve often doubted whether I’ve a soul myself. And
I’m sure Inez hasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At all events, the poets thought you were not as pretty
without one. We disagreed with the Church. We always
have. So we took you in hand. Your soul was born, my
dear Joan, in Provence, about the year 1100.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to be a little interested, but looked at her tiny
watch—grey platinum with a frosty twinkle of diamonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on. I’ve ten minutes more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—we were sorry for you. We were the Troubadours
of Provence, and we found you kicked into the mud
by the Church, flung out into the world to earn your bread
in various disreputable ways—by marriage, and otherwise.
You simply didn’t exist. We found your beautiful dead
body in the snow and mud. And we picked you up and
warmed you and set you on a throne all gold and jewels.
Virtually, you never breathed until we wrote poems about
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jewels! We have always liked jewels,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We gave you a wonderful crown first, all white and shining.
We made you Queen of Heaven, and then even the
Church had to eat humble pie and worship you, for you were
Mary. We did that—we only. But that wasn’t enough.
You opened your eyes, and grew proud and spoiled, and
heaven was by no means enough. You wanted more. You
would be Queen of Earth, too. And we did it! We gave
you a crown of red jewels,—red like heart’s blood,—and we
put a sceptre in your hand, and we fell down and worshipped
you. And you were Venus. And you have been Queen of
Europe and the New World ever since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of Europe only? Not of Asia? Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they are much too old and wise in Asia. They are
much wiser than we. Wiser than the Church. Wiser than
the poets—than any of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—let’s think. That you have your uses—<span class='it'>uses</span>.
That you are valuable in so far as you bear children and are
obedient to your husbands. That, outside that, your beauty
has its uses also within limits that are rather strictly marked.
That in many rebirths you will develop your soul and be
immortal; if you behave, that is! If not—then who shall
say? But you have your chance all the time. With them
you are neither goddess or fiend. You are just women.
Not even Woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ghastly materialism!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! The happy mean. The perfect wisdom.
Meanwhile, you yourselves are all hunting after the ideals
of the market-place, the platform, the pulpit. I wonder
how many extra rebirths it will cost you! Never mind.
Time is long. The gods are never in a hurry, and you will
arrive even if you only catch the last train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is all fault-finding, and unfair at that. Will
you have the goodness to advise? If we stick on our pedestals,
you all run off to the frivolers. If we frivol, you weep
for the pedestal. What is it you really want? If we knew,
we’d try to deliver the goods, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not!” I said, and reflected. Then, gathering resolution,
“Have you the patience to listen to a story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it’s a good one. How long will it take?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten minutes. The author is the Serpent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll certainly put off Inez for fifteen minutes.
Who’s it about?”—running to the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eve, Lilith, Adam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was Lilith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adam’s first love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down, her eyes dancing, her lips demure; the prettiest
combination!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know he had one. But I might have guessed.
They always have. Go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on, and this is the story.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“You were speaking of the pedestal. That, of course,
was invented in Eden; for Adam early recognized the convenience
of knowing where to leave your women and be certain
of finding them on your return. So he made the pedestal,
decorated it, burned incense before it, and went away
upon his own occasions; and when Eve had finished her
housekeeping (you may remember, Milton tells us what
good little dinners she provided for Adam), she would look
bored, climb upon the pedestal obediently, and stand there
all day, yawning and wondering what kept him away so
long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, on a memorable day, the Serpent came by, and
stopped and looked up at the Lady of the Garden,—who
naturally assumed a statuesque pose,—and there was joy in
his bright little eyes. But all he said was, ‘May I ask if
you find this amusing?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Eve replied, ‘No, not at all. But it is the proper
place for a lady.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Serpent rejoined: ‘Why?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Eve reflected and answered: ‘Because Adam says
so.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the Serpent drew near and whispered in his soft sibilant
voice: ‘Have you ever heard of Lilith? <span class='it'>She</span> does not
stand on a pedestal. She gardens with Adam. To be
frank, she is a cousin of my own.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this made Eve extremely angry, and she replied
sharply: ‘I don’t know what you mean. He and I are
alone in Eden. There’s no such person as Lilith. You are
only a serpent when all’s said and done. What can you
know?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Serpent replied very gently,—and his voice was
as soothing as the murmur of a distant hive of bees,—‘I am
only a Serpent, true! But I have had unusual opportunities
of observation. Come and eat of the Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil. Long ages ago I tasted the Fruit.
The savour of my teeth is sweet on it still.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eve hesitated, and she who hesitates is lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I own I should like to know about this Lilith,’ she said.
‘But we were told that fruit is unripe, and I don’t like bitter
things. Is it bitter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Serpent narrowed his eyes until they shone like
slits of emerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sweet!’ he said; ‘come.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she descended from the pedestal, and, guided by the
Serpent, stood before that wondrous Tree where every apple
shines like a star among its cloudy leaves. And she plucked
one, and, tasting it, flung the rest angrily at the Serpent, because
it was still a little unripe; and having tasted the Fruit
Forbidden, she returned to the pedestal, pondering, with the
strangest new thoughts quickening in her brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Adam noticed anything when he came back that evening,
it was only that Eve was a little more silent than usual,
and forgot to ask if the thornless roses were striking root.
She was thinking deeply, but there were serious gaps in her
knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first result of her partial enlightenment was that,
though she now only used the pedestal as a clothes-peg and
spent all her spare time in stalking Adam and Lilith, she always
scrambled up in hot haste when he returned. He could
be certain of finding her there when he expected to, and he
made a point of that because, as he said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No truly nice woman would ever want to leave it and
go wandering about the Garden. It does not do for a respectable
woman to be seen speaking even to an Archangel
nowadays, so often does the Devil assume the form of an
Angel of Light. You never can tell. And besides, there is
always the Serpent, who, in my opinion, should never have
been admitted.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eve said nothing, which was becoming a habit. She only
folded her little hands meekly and accepted the homage
paid to the pedestal with perfect gravity and decorum. He
never suspected until much later that she knew what a comparatively
interesting time Lilith was having, and had indeed
called on that lady at the other end of the Garden, with
friendly results. She was well aware that Lilith’s footing
on the garden paths was much more slippery and unsafe
than her own on the pedestal. Still, there were particulars
which she felt would be useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Adam realized the facts, he realized also that he
was face to face with a political crisis of the first magnitude.
If they fraternized, those two, of such different characters
and antecedents, there was nothing they could not know—nothing
they might not do! The pedestal was rocking to its
very foundation. The gardening with Lilith must end.
She would demand recognition; Eve would demand freedom.
It might mean a conspiracy—a boycott. What was there
it might not mean? He scarcely dared to think. Eden
was crumbling about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a desperate emergency, and as he sat with a racking
head, wishing them both in—Paradise, the Serpent happened
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Surely you look a little harassed,’ he said, stopping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adam groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is it as bad as all that?’ the Serpent asked, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Worse.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What have they been at?’ asked the Serpent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They each know too much, and they will soon know
more,’ he rejoined gloomily. ‘Knowledge is as infectious
as potato blight.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Serpent replied with alacrity: ‘In this dreadful
situation you must know most. It is the only remedy.
Come and eat at once of the Fruit of the Tree. I have never
understood why you did not do that the moment the Rib
took shape.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Adam, like Eve asked: ‘Is it sweet?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the Serpent narrowed his eyes till they shone like slits
of ruby, and said, ‘Bitter, but appetizing. Come.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Adam replied: ‘I like bitters before dinner.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all know what happened then; with the one exception
that, as a matter of fact, he found the apple a little overripe,
too sweet, even cloying; and not even swallowing what
he had tasted, he threw the rest away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is just as well to have this version, for it must have
been always perfectly clear that Eve, having tasted the apple
and thus acquired a certain amount of wisdom, could never
have desired to share it with Adam. [“I have thought that
myself,” murmured Joan.] No, it was the Serpent’s doing
in both cases; though naturally Adam blamed Eve when the
question was raised, for she had begun it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what was the result? Well, there were several. It
has, of course, been a trial of wits between Adam, Eve, and
Lilith ever since. But, in tasting, he had learned one maxim
which the Romans thought they invented thousands of years
later. It flashed into his mind one day, when he saw the
two gathering roses together and found his dinner was half
an hour late in consequence. It was simply this: Divide
and Rule. Combined, he could never manage them; the
sceptre was daily slipping from his hand. Divided, he
could. So he put the maxim in practice and sowed division
and distrust between Eve and Lilith. They ceased to visit
each other, and were cuts when they met. And, naturally,
after the Eviction the meetings ceased entirely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have understood before this, my dear Joan, that
Adam was the first mortal to realize the value of competition.
He now became the object of spirited competition between
the two. Each in her own way outbid the other to
secure his regard. Eve’s domestic virtues grew oppressive;
Lilith’s recklessness alarming. And it will readily be seen
why women have pursued men, rather than the other way
over, as we see it in the lower walks of creation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t prose,” said Joan. “What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, in the last few years, the Serpent, who is always
upsetting things, happened along again, and found Eve
balancing in extreme discomfort on the pedestal, and
Lilith resting, exhausted, after a particularly hard day’s
pursuit of Adam. And between them was a wall of icy
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He paused and said with his usual courtesy, ‘Ladies, you
both seem fatigued. Is it permitted to ask the reason?’
And his voice had all the murmuring of all the doves of
Arcady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Lilith replied angrily: ‘I’m sick of hunting Adam.
I always catch him and always know I shall. And he wants
to be caught, and yet insists on being hunted before he gives
me the rewards. Who can keep up any interest in a game
like that? If it were not for Eve, who would take up the
running if I dropped it, he might go to Gehenna for me!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how true! I like Lilith best!” whispered Joan.
She was not smoking now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Strong, but pardonable,’ said the Serpent. ‘And you,
dear Lady?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Eve, casting a jealous scowl at Lilith, replied: ‘I’m
weary of this abominable pedestal. If you had stood on it
off and on for five thousand years, you would realize the
cramp it means in the knees. But I daren’t get off, for
Adam says no truly nice woman ever would leave it, and it
pleases him. If it were not for Lilith, who would be upon
it in two seconds, I should be off it in less. And then where
should I be? She <span class='it'>will</span> go on hunting him, and of course he
must have quiet at home.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And you <span class='it'>will</span> go on standing on your imbecile pedestal,
and of course such boredom makes him restless abroad,’ retorted
the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the momentary silence that ensued, the Serpent looked
up at Lilith and narrowed his eyes till they shone like slits
of amethyst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My cousin,’ he said, ‘our family was old when Adam
was created. He is poor game.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Nobody knows that better than I,’ said Lilith tartly.
‘What do you suppose I hunt him for?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What, indeed!’ said the Serpent, hissing softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Because of Eve—that only!’ she flashed at him. ‘She
never shall triumph over me. And what there is to give,
he has.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned to Eve, narrowing his eyes till they shone like
slits of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And you stand cramped on this pedestal, beloved Lady?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Because of Lilith—that only! She, at all events, shall
not have him. And think of his morals!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Aha!” said Joan, with intense conviction.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Serpent mused and curved his shining head toward
Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If you will allow me to say so, I have always regretted
that you never finished that apple, and that my cousin Lilith
has never tasted it at all,’ he murmured. ‘A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing, as certain also of your own poets
have said.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I have sometimes thought so, too,’ Eve replied mournfully;
‘and there is a word that now and then flashes across
my brain like an echo from the past, but I can never quite
recall it. It might explain matters. Still, it is no use talking.
That apple rotted long ago, and if the Tree is still
growing, which I doubt, there is always a guard of flying
infantry at the Gate. It is easier to get out than in where
Eden is concerned.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Serpent smiled blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have evidently forgotten that, by arrangement with
the Governing Body, I have always free ingress and egress.
Look here!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He unfolded his iridescent coils, and there lay within
them—shining, mystic, wonderful, against his velvet bloom—two
Apples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no hesitation, for each was equally weary of
Adam’s requirements; and, snatching each an Apple, they
ate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the Fruit has grown bitter since the days of the
Garden. There is nothing so bitter as knowledge. Their
lips were wried, and the tears came, and still they ate until
not an atom remained. The Serpent watched. For a moment
each stared upon the other, trembling like a snared
bird, wild thoughts coming and going in the eyes of the
Barren Woman and the Mother of all Living. Then Eve
stretched out her arms, and Lilith flung herself into them,
and they clung together, weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Serpent opened his eyes until they shone like
sun, moon, and stars all melted into one; and he said, ‘Ladies,
the word you are seeking is, I think, <span class='it'>Combination</span>.’
And smiling subtly, he went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Eve descended from her pedestal and trampled it; and
Lilith broke the rod of her evil enchantments; and they
walked hand in hand, blessing the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adam meanwhile was shooting,—big game, little game,—and,
amid the pressure of such important matters, never
paid any attention to this trifle. But this was the beginning
of what will be the biggest trade-union the world will
ever see. All the women who matter will be within it, and
the black-legs outside will be the women who don’t count.
So now you see why men will not much longer have a run
(literally) for their money. Adam may have to put up
with it, for he never ate the Apple as Eve and Lilith have
done, and therefore does not know so much about the things
of real importance. Unless indeed the Serpent— But we
won’t think of that until it happens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my dear Joan, whether all this is a good or a bad
thing, who can tell? The Serpent undoubtedly shuffled the
cards; and who the Serpent is and what are his intentions,
are certainly open questions. Some believe him to be the
Devil, but the minority think his true name is Wisdom. All
one really can say is that the future lies on the knees of the
gods, and that among all men the Snake is the symbol of
Knowledge, and is therefore surrounded with fear and
hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s the story, and don’t you think there’s a kind
of moral?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waited for a comment. Joan was in deep meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” she said slowly, “it’s the truest thing I
ever heard. It’s as true as taxes. But where do <span class='it'>you</span> come
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t thinking of us,” I said hurriedly. “I merely
meant—if you wished to be more attractive——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Attractive!”—with her little nose in the air. “I guess
it’s you that will have to worry about your attractions, if
that comes along. I won’t waste any more time on you to-day.
I’ve got to think this out, and talk it out, too, with
Inez and Janet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and began to pull on her gloves, but absently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt exactly like a man who has set a time-fuse in a
powder magazine. The Serpent himself must have possessed
me when I introduced his wisdom to a head cram-full
of it already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the merest nonsense, Joan. It isn’t in the Talmud.
The Serpent never thought of it. I made it all up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t. It isn’t in you. Or, if you did, it was an
inspiration from on high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From below,” I said weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled to herself—a dangerous smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go. And you really were a little less dull than
usual. Come again on Tuesday. The moral of it all is, so
far, that the poets are really worth cultivating. I will begin
with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flashed away like a humming bird, and I retired, to
read my Schopenhauer. But the serious question is—shall
I go on Tuesday?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(A letter from Mr. Amyand Tylliol to his friend, Mr. Endymion Porter
at the Court of his Majesty, King Charles the First.)</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To my kind and constant friend, that lover of the Muses,
Mr. Endymion Porter, to whose understanding heart all
confidences may be carried, these presents to bring my news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since you marvel at the delay of your humble servant
needs must I tell you of a singular hap which hath befallen.
Yet no hurt, therefore be not distrest, for all is well. And
truth it is that I have met a most ingenious gentleman, and
this is the marrow of what I would say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, prospering in my journey, I did reach Exeter, and
there in the shadow of the Cathedral Church, transacted
my affair with Mr. Delander as foreseen. And a right fair
and noble church it is, rich beyond imagining with images
of kings and bishops, queens and holy martyrs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Mr. Stephen Delander (who quarters the arms of
Tylliol with his own from an alliance in the days of Queen
Elizabeth of blessed memory, and therefore calls cousin with
me) have I received most hospitable entertainment, and
noble conversation enriched with such sparkling gems of
poesy and rhetoric as cannot be told in words. And hence
is he become my singular good friend and as such to be remembered
and cherished. His house lies in the Cathedral
precincts and is by all the city known as Domus Domini,
the Lord’s House, since it belonged to the foundation of
the Cathedral in days now like to be forgot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And ’tis a house delightful to the fancy, in a very small
garden set with a few sombre trees, enlightened with clove-gilly
flowers and roses, and box hedges with winding walks
among the turf. Within, deep-windowed, with grave and
handsome plenishing and great store of books clothing the
walls, and all of a sober discretion that bespeaks a gentleman
of lineage and parts. And over it towers the cathedral
church the which (looking upward) appears to swim in the
blue as though native to the skies, and sheds from its mighty
bells a voice of warning over the clustering city with every
passing hour, for a <span class='it'>memento mori</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A place indeed for the feeding of pensive musing and the
relishing of the fair-zoned Muses even as in the groves of
Academe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, business concluded, ’twas the habit of Mr. Delander
and myself to sit in the oriel commanding the cathedral and
to hold sweet discourse, with a flagon of right Canary between
us, and from one of these exchanges sprang my delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he, talking of the writing of the rare Master Ben
Jonson, spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A poet indeed, but sure Mr. Tylliol, being a lover of
verse and a trafficker in its niceties, knows we have here in
this rude Devonshire a poet—nay, what say I?—<span class='it'>the</span> poet
of women and flowers and elves that skip by moonlight,
with like delights of the phantasy, such as rare Ben or even
the rarer Master Shakespeare cannot excel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, sir!” says I. “I stand amazed. I knew it not.
Who may the gentleman be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not have you think,” he responded, “that this
gentleman hath the choir note of our young Milton, nor
yet the plenteous invention of Will Shakespeare. ’Tis a
country Muse, but exquisite. A muse withal that hath been
to town and drest her lovely limbs in lawns and silks, and
wears pomander beads in her bosom. A Muse whose blush
is claret and cream commingled. And as I said, exquisite.
A voice of Castaly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what does the gentleman in the wilds and what is
he?” asked I, a-tip-toe with curiosity, for well you know my
passion for these rarities. And hastily I added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hath your honour any taste or relish of his verse at hand
to whet my appetite? For with poetry as with manners—from
one can all be told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mused a moment smiling, then recited thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a pure seed-pearl,” said I. “Small but Orient.
And now, Mr. Delander my worthy friend, tell me where
hides this shepherd of the enchanted pipe, for if, as you say,
in Devon, then Devon I will not quit till with these tickling
ears have I listened to his sweet pipings. And if Julia be his
neighbour, as we may suppose— O, sir, speak by the cards
and tell me true!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is,” he responded, “in this His Majesty’s shire
of Devon, a very savage forest, yet with no trees,—known
as the Forest of Dartmoor. And well may I call it savage,
for there do savages harbour that would make as little to
slit a man’s throat and cast him in a slough as I to toss this
nut-shell. Of the roads to these parts, least said soonest
mended—sooner indeed than they. But know that around
this execrable miscreant of a Dartmoor lie little lovely villages
full of a sweet civility of flowers and hives of bees,
and kine and pretty maids to milk ’em. And above all
there is one called Dean Prior and of this the spiritual shepherd
is Mr. Robert Herrick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure his crook is wreathed with roses and the pretty
lambs of the flock have nought to fear from their shepherd,”
says I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take your meaning, Mr. Tylliol, and yet—[he paused
here with a peculiar sweet smile]—though you might decipher
much from his verses of Julias, Dianemes, Perillas,
and other charming ladies, and he is much accused as a loose
liver, ’tis possible to read his riddle wrong. Go therefore
and see him. I have known another who did this and returned
surprised. Yet cross not Dartmoor on your life,
but go softly below it where honest folk live. Also, a coach
goes down two days hence within two miles of the village
and with it a riding guard. Take your stout nag, and so
God bless you and send you a happy meeting with a man
not commonly to be accosted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>’Twas in vain for me to beshrew and becall myself for
the veriest ass between this and London, and doubtless I had
flinched from so great an enterprise but that Mr. Delander
poured verses more and more mellifluous into mine ears until
at last I was as Ulysses, drunk with the fierce wine of the
Sirens’ voices, and there being no mast whereto to bind me
and Mr. Delander full of laughing incitements, I set forth
to follow the track of music as a bee the track of the unseen
rose’s perfume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the roads I forbear to speak, and the harbourage by
the way would willingly forget, but the air was sweet and
fragrant with earliest summer and the fields yet gilt with
cowslips and I spied a few late primroses lingering about the
roots of trees in the shy copses. Also, an exceeding delicate
flower like a silver star, that made sweet constellation
in the lush grass. And could the courtesies of London be
imported I know not where a man might better fleet the
hours than in this warm and languid shire of Devon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, on the fourth day we observed a wild mountain
stream, browner than October ale, that rushing danced to
meet us, breaking in a thousand showers, spray, and rillets
among its rocks—a lovely thing to see and hear—the youngest
surely of the bright nymphs of the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this,” says the guard of the coach, “is the Dean
Burn, and not far off the Vicarage, and the few houses
of the village are far down the road where we shall presently
come. So here, worshipful sir, we leave you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, being arrived and the coach still standing to discharge
certain packets for the parson I spied a comely man
in middle age coming to meet us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was drest in hodden grey, clean but simple, his head
bare and the sunshine on it, and his eyes smiled with his
mouth. And in that first sight I gave my liking to Mr. Herrick,
and so has it continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I presented my letter from Mr. Delander, and of the
cordial of my welcome need I not to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, what favour?” said he. “Sure to a rustic that once
knew London, pinioned here to rude rocks and trees, ’tis
like a scent of the kindly civil streets to see an accomplished
gentleman. Blush not, sir, for so I have it under Mr.
Delander’s hands and seal, and I know no better judge.
’Tis little I can give, but my pleasant maid, Prudence
Baldwin, hath a bed with sun-bleacht sheets in waiting for
the traveller, and my roof is weather-proof, and my little
creeking hen, foreseeing a friend, hath made shift to lay her
long white egg, and this rascally riveret that I have abused
in verse, yet love, hath provided fresh-dewed cresses for
our meat. If with these and a very little more, my guest’s
hunger can be satiate, then welcome again—thrice welcome
to Dean Prior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With gladness I accepted, for the welcome was as much
in his eye as on his lip, and so we came to the low house
seated in a small garden gay with gilliflowers, culver-keys,
sops-in-wine, lad’s love, and all the outspread courtiers that
pay homage to the rose. And roses he had, great store,
both damask and white, and the party-coloured York and
Lancaster—to the which he drew my notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord, what a little house, and poor though neat, and yet
with sparkles of money here and there in a rich picture or
two, and a settle and chest carved by no ’prentice hand, and
a worn but costly velvet cloak thrown over the back. And
a clock, grave as Time himself, with a dial curiously illustrated
with mottoes and cherubims. And before entering I
took notice that a sun-dial stood in the garden, with this
verse engraved<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> so as the gnomon should point the lesson:</p>

<p class='noindent'>Which methought a devout reflection pleasing to Christian
ears, and so I said, but he smiling put it by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now with a handsome curtsey Mrs. Prue met us, coming
from her kitchen, a kindly buxom woman with flowered
skirt pulled up through her pockets, and a cap white as the
foam on Dean Burn, and in her hospitable hand a little
server, she pressing us to drink a cup of ale before our
dinner served. And so showed me to my little cell with
lavender stuck in the windows, and sheets that might have
wrapt the smooth limbs of the divine Julia, though I dare
to say they never did. And since the bed was spread with
down pulled from the Vicar’s own geese it invited a pure and
honest slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, marry! when we came to dine, that I thought should
have been on eggs and cresses at the best, here was a surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For before Master Vicar were laid two smoking trouts,
broiled to a turn over sea-coals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of these,” says mine host, “you may eat fearless,
for they were caught in Dean Burn, and of all clean livers
commend me to the trout that is indeed a dainty monsieur;
and these inhabit in water clear as crystal beams, unlike
those degenerate fish that scavenge in Thames. And moreover,
these hands took them this morning, for I am a brother
of the rod, and love to sit a-angling and a-musing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And needs must I say that these trout with Mrs. Prue’s
sauce, the rich droppings of the fish mixed with fresh sweet
butter and the yolk of an egg, was a dish for feasting Gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>’Twas followed by a bird trapt on the moor, of a reddish
flesh and <span class='it'>haut gout</span> very delicious, and what should come
after that but a junket with nutmegs grated and clouted
cream—so yellow, thick and mellow that I praised and commended
and Mr. Herrick heapt my platter until I cried
quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cream of cowslips,” says he, “for the meadows whence it
was drawn are gilt with their fragrant blossoms and the
leisurely cows lie among them and crush their sweetness
as well as devour it. And if you condescend later to taste
it with a crust of Mrs. Prue’s bread and her marmalet of
crab-apples, you shall say it is good honest country fare
if simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rose content from a meal excelling all the varieties of
rich men’s tables, and on his proposal we sat a while under
his honey-suckle bower to look upon the prospect and digest
our meat seemly, while Mrs. Prue moved softly about the
house clearing and cleansing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And seeing the moment favourable, I adventured a question
much in my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, in your divine and honey-golden verse, recited to
me by our common friend, Mr. Delander, you speak with
opprobrium of this rude Devonshire. Yet here I come and
find you set amid delights of soul and body such as a king
might envy. Is it true that you, looking on these sweet
hills and meadows, this singing riveret and the hues and
scents of your garden, can wish yourself in the noise and
foulness of towns? Resolve me this doubt, for, trust me, it
perplexes me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, is a poet wiser than another that he should
not long for the rainbow a field away? You are to take
notice that when I lived in London I abused the smells and
sights and craved for country quiet. And now I have it
’tis the other way about. But in all good soberness this is
the better life and I know it. Here is the eye enlarged to
beauty, the ear attuned to music celestial, and the company,
though not choicely good, is innocent, and if evil, hath no
tinsel to hide its native ugliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused a moment as though to digest his thoughts
and added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we rise with Chanticleer and make the lamb our
curfew, and the day’s small cares ended and our souls committed
to the Keeper who sleeps not, we slumber discharged
of griefs. And if our food be plain the seasoning is thanks.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He smiled so cheerfully that I enquired:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your own verse, reverend sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own. My Muse is not always concerned with
ladies’ eyes nor with the revels of Mab and Oberon whereof
I have also delighted to write. She kneels sometimes, face
veiled. And these I call my Noble Numbers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence, so great that through the
singing of the water I might hear the cropping of Clover-lips,
his red cow. ’Twas not long however before I
resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, sir, the country is now your choice preferred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said not so. Nay, I long sometimes for the town.
But I know and scarce know how, that my lot will be cast
there again for some sad years, and then I shall return here
to lay my bones in peace among my people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was this revealed to you in dream, sir? But this question
is overbold. Few men reveal their dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine,” says he, “are so chaste as I dare tell them. Yes,
in a dream. Doubtless induced by the present discontents
which will wreck our good King Charles and many lesser
with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We discoursed of these, and with each word I liked mine
host the better, until his gentleness emboldened me so much
that at the last I said;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where, worthy sir, are the houses of the lovely and
wealthy ladies who keep you good company in summer
sunshine and winter snow? Where dwells the stately Mistress
Julia, bright and straight as a garden tulip, a flower
which I confess the Roman name of Julia calls always to my
sight. Where the sparkling-eyed lady Dianeme, the shy
Anthea, the delicate Perilla light as a woodland anemone,
and all this shining garden of sweets that your muse commends
to our worship? Let me own nor blush for’t, that
my journey, though undertaken to their poet, was seasoned
also with the hope to kiss their feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, you did well. The Hesperides are worth even a
journey to Devon. And doubtless you shall see the stately
Julia, and the bright Anthea and all the fair choir, but not
yet. And now will I repeat you my latest homage to one of
these ladies, and then I must needs visit my sick while you
sit in the meadow and watch the milkmaid at her fragrant
labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O exquisite felicity!” cried I with delight. “And did it
not move your empress to mercy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It moved her, sir!” he answered with a subdued laughter.
“And now must I forth. Entertain yourself, I pray you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went toward the village, bearing in his hand a well-stored
panier brought forth by Mrs. Prue, in the which I
might espy little pots and pipkins clearly bespeaking a charitable
heart. And when he disappeared I took in hand the

Burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the sun was bright and the water like dancing diamonds
and its song so dulcet that even with my good will I

so I e’en turned over in the short sweet-smelling grass and
there fell asleep and dreamed of Julia with her smooth rubious
lips and velvet cheek, and of the banquets of elves
and their midnight rejoicings, but dimly and with the sound
of water in it all, until I fell in the very deeps of slumber
and dreamed no more.</p>

gown of blue and had on her head nothing but a straw
hat bought at the fair. For her skin was cream with here
and there a cowslip freckle, and she was cherry-cheeked and
had withal a soft black eye and two clear-marked arches of
brows, and lips that you would not have smile lest the perfect
bow unbend, nor smiling would have grave lest the
quarrelet of pearls be hidden. And about her neck and
bosom was folded very modestly a handkerchief tucked into
her bodice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I rose to my feet and made my bow, for beauty,
though but in a milk-maiden, is native to the skies and enforces
homage, and the pretty maid blushing dropt so deep a
curtsey that I thought she must take root in the grass like
a flower, so long was it before she lifted the stars of her
eyes to mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was bid by his Reverence, sir, to stroke you a syllabub,”
says she. “And will your Honour have it here and
now, for I have the verjuice of crab-apple and all needful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here and now if you’ll favour me,” says I enchanted,
and sat down to watch the lovely sight. Nor could I have
departed if even she had bid me;</p>

voice as she rounded a song to coax the cows let down their

<p class='pindent'>“For ’tis known they always milk best to music,” says she,
“and often I would have Jan Holdsworthy to bring his pipe

<p class='pindent'>And thus I heard a Devon ballad, whereof a verse sticks
in my head:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, but I won’t sing the next bit,” says she with her

<p class='pindent'>“And why, my pretty lass?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Robin went for to be uncivil and kiss the maid

<p class='pindent'>She trilled it out, defiant as a thrush at dawn, and I could
have committed Robin’s crime but for respect to her innocence
and Mr. Herrick’s hospitality. And sure never was a
syllabub so delicate and warm as this, strained from the
balm-breathing kine through sunburnt hands fresh rinsed
with sparkling water from Dean Burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drank that wine of Nature’s brewing nor could be satisfied.
And when her pails foamed to the brim and Clover-lips
and Pretty Primrose returned disburdened to their
cropping, says I:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, my pretty one, where are the great houses
about these parts where dwell the fair and splendid ladies
who excel you in nothing but their wealth? And do they
come to the church o’ Sundays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anan, sir?” says she, bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ladies in silks and lawns and jewels,” I insisted.
“Of whom I have read as shedding the lustre of their graces
even on these wild and solitary meads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Methinks my talk was too fine for her. She laught like
one amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies, your honour, I know of none, nor never saw silk
nor lawn nor lady, nor heard of such but in the ballads the
chapmen bring to the fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sure there are great squires and lords in these parts
and will have their hunting and sports and their ladies to
ride with them, and come to church in coaches and on pillions
a-Sundays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, your honour, no,” says she. “I would it were so.
’Twere fine to see the young madams, gay as kingfishers on
Dean Burn, but never saw I one, nor look to. And now I
must be going, with your leave, for I must sit at my wheel
or our dame will know the reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with another curtsey the fair pretty maid departed to
her innocent labour, and ’twas as though the sun went
with her, so clear and lucid a beam was she of youth and
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she left me musing, for where and how should Mr.
Herrick meet with his fair ladies unless indeed he took horse
and rode abroad, and I perpended and resolved to watch,
being sharp-set to see his peerless beauties if I died for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To grace our supper on Mr. Herrick’s return were the
cresses from the Dean Burn and little young radishes from
the garden with a cream cheese dewy in green leaves and a
dish of eggs dressed in an amulet by Mrs. Prue (and savoury
meat they were) and a tansy pudding to follow. And if I
be charged with gluttony in thus citing I crave pardon, for
I know not how but the mind sat down with the body to
the feast and both were nourished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Prue, the prudent, brought us after a very little glass
each of surfeit-water and of such comfort that I would
needs have her recipe, the which she imparted very gravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We take of red corn poppies a peck and put them in a
dish with another for cover, and so into the oven several
times after the household bread is drawn. We lay them
in a quart of aqua vitæ [“And this,” interrupted Mr. Herrick,
“comes very good from the sea-covers by Plymouth,
and is brought to us on moor ponies.”] and thereto we add
a race of ginger sliced, nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, a handful
of figs, raisins-of-the-sun, aniseed, cardamom and fennel
seeds, with a taste of lickorish. And so lay some poppies
in a great vessel and then the other ingredients and more
poppies and so continue till the vessel’s full. We then pour
in our aqua vitæ and let it so continue until very red with
the poppies and strong of the spice. We take from it what
we need, adding more aqua vitæ. And much good may
it do your Honour for ’tis a known cordial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so!” says I sipping, “and trust me, I am beholden
to you, good Mrs. Prudence, and will benefit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left our glasses empty and betook ourselves to the
bower in the garden so twined and wreathed with the
gold and amber horns of honey-suckle spilling their fragrance
that my soul was ravisht, and Mr. Herrick fetching
his lute saluted mine ears with strains celestial, adding his
voice thereto at moments, yet not loud but as if thinking
melodiously to himself in serene reverie in the deepening twilight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He plucked a few notes and was silent, for Philomel in a
thorn beside the Dean broke forth, amazing the night with
harmony, and holding breath we listened to the sweet delirium
that hath enchanted the ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopt as suddenly as she began and flew to some more
distant groves to duel with another songster as lovely,
the moon herself in rising seeming to pause and listen ere
she ascended her silver throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exquisite!” says he sighing. “How have I the rude
audacity to match my numbers with hers? Yet I too have
my breast on a thorn and must sing or die. And you assert
that they please, Mr. Tylliol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They enchant,” cried I eagerly. “But, O, Mr. Herrick,
my good host and worthy friend, I beseech you reveal
to me where hide the Hesperides you celebrate in verse that
will not die like Philomel’s. Few are my days here. Let
me not return empty. With the most awful reverence will
I stand at a distance to admire, nor with a thought smirch
the crystalline lawn that veils the bosom of Madam Julia or
the silks that rustle in Dianeme’s going. What—what are
the earthly names of these admired ladies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In one hour, when the moon is up and at full, then you
shall meet them,” says he. “For then they do use to give
me gracious tryst beyond Dean Burn at a certain place
known to me and to them. And if their beauty is not correspondent
to your expectation, blame not them, but consider
rather the teaching of Plotinus his book wherein he
writes: ‘That which sees must be kindred and similar to
its object before it can see it. Every man must partake
of the divine nature before he can see Divinity.’ So then,
if they appear not lovely the fault is in the eye that sees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir,” says I bewildered; “is this so also with the
perishable beauty of women which leads man into ways
unallied indeed with Divinity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched a few soft notes on the pensive strings, responding
gravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man hath never beheld the beauty of woman whom
it leads downward, but only a shadow and simulacrum, as
it were; the false Duessa, whereas the true Una (the One)
is crowned with stars and in its nature heavenly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have conversed, as is known to my friend, with many
men counted high, but, trust me, here with the world
charmed by moonlight and the quiet running of water, the
voice of this man took on a quality unearthly and you are
to know that it moved me exceedingly as with something
latent and not to be exprest. Nor would I answer but sat
attentive while he pursued his thoughts aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For so says also the wisest man that ever wore flesh
(setting aside only the Bright and Orient Star) and these
are his words: ‘Such a man uses the beauties of earth as
steps whereon he mounts, going from fair forms to fair
deeds, and from fair deeds to fair thoughts, and from fair
thoughts attains to the Idea of Absolute Beauty. And if a
man have eyes to see this true Beauty he becomes the friend
of God and immortal.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after this we both observed such a silence as when
sweet music dies and leaves the air ravisht and in ecstasy,
and so sate I know not how long until at last the moon
glided over the trees and threw her light on the Dean Burn.
He then arose, still holding his lute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would see my beauties, Mr. Tylliol, and that you
shall! Come with me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so led the way to a part where the water spread wide,
glittering and very shallow, and here great flat stepping-stones
used by generations, as he told me, and on these we
crost and went on and up (our path clear as day) until, it
might be half a mile or more, we came to a singular little
amphitheatre (so I may call it) of turf, short and cropt
and soft as kings’ carpets, with thick bushes and trees and
some rocks surrounding it, very secret and secluded, enclosing
it into a fair pleasance but not large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here I often sit,” he whispered. “But go very
softly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed a natural awe, of I know not what, fell on me
and constrained me into a breathless quiet, following him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So presently we seated ourselves on a low rock cushioned
with moss, and then taking his lute he began to play gently,
but with such a penetrating sweetness as Orpheus himself,
who with his music melted the hearts of trees and rocks,
could scarce, I think exceed, yet most simple withal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the melody was singular, and with a delicate continuity
like the ceaseless running of rain or water, and after
awhile it appeared to me as if, like a revolving spinning
wheel, it cast abroad silver threads which mingling with the
moonlight did dance and whirl and shape themselves into
changing forms (but I know not what) dissolving and returning
and re-shaping in a labyrinth that mazed me. And
whether it was my own brain that spun them (as in dream)
I cannot tell, nor whether they were real or imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But presently a sweetly lovely face peeped from the
boughs, finger on lips, the pointed chin elfish as though the
cap should be a flower, a truant indeed from Fairyland.
And “Silvia!” he whispered, continuing to play. She, if
she it were, listened, archly smiling, a face and no more, and
suddenly the leaves closed about her, and nothing there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My breath stumbled in my throat, and I closed my eyes
an instant, and when again they opened, at the further end
of the pleasance, but dim in the moonlight as though in a
mist of lawn and cobweb lace, I saw a lady pace from one
covert to the other. And myself this time, but whether
aloud I know not, said: “Madam Julia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For she moved imperial, but her beauty I cannot itemize,
nor know now whether I saw or dreamed her lips—</p>

<p class='noindent'>nor the black splendour of her hair, and the proud dark
glance she cast about her in passing, nor the splendid
sweeping of her gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as she parted the boughs and Dian-like was hid
among them, came another following, but stepping lightly
from behind a rock whereon a tree laid leafy fingers of
lucent green,—a creature of soft and flower-wafting breezes,
white and sunbeam-haired, and I dare swear the ray of her
eyes was blue, though see them I did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mr. Herrick, speaking as in time to his lute, seemed
to say:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>White and heaven-like crystalline,”—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and she waved a moonbeam hand as he whispered and,
springing as lightly between the rocks and boughs as a leaping
stream, was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly his lute ceased as though to give place to
a better and a lady, robed in white, came cradling a lute
to her bosom and singing—O words melodious, melting
into heavenly numbers—I believe I knew at the blessed
moment what they were but now have they slipt my gross
understanding. For ’twas indeed the choice Myrrha—O
Music, O maid divine, walking soundless as flowing
water and bathing in her own sweet harmonies as a Naiad in
her native crystal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as she past, unheeding her worshipper, Mr.
Herrick’s lute resumed the strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now past two fair ladies, close entwined as Hermia
and Helena, whispering each in the other’s ear and casting
oblique and tender looks upon their poet, the one in a yellow
robe like a spring daffodil and the other in a most pure
violet, perfume-breathing as the hue she wore. And the
first was crowned with may, white as ivory exprest in
blossom, and my heart said for me, “Corinna, who will go
a-maying while the world lasts.</p>

<p class='noindent'>And indeed she past me so near that I caught the almond-sweet
breath of her wreath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the other sure was the lady Dianeme, for I knew her
by her dancing shining eyes and the bough of blossomed
laylock in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet what could she be but proud of what the world counts
among its jewels? And after them came running the delicate
Perilla to join herself to their garland, and so smoothly
did she glide that I looked to see her shod with the winged
sandals of Hermes, for not a blade bent as she past, and
so she slipt across the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then a little crowd of sweet shadows—Perenna the
lovely, Sappho (but not she of the Leucadian rock), the
Delaying Lady with handsome sullen brows, and lips pouted
in half disdain, the beloved Electra, graceful as a harebell
on a breeze, the reluctant Oenone and many others, fair
and Orient gems set in a carcanet for the Muse’s wearing.
And after them a young Cupid, kitten-eyed and mischievous
with his bow braced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at this the air filled suddenly with nimble laughters
and little cries flipt with merry breath in the trees above
us, and small shapes drunk with dew and moonlight dropt
from the boughs like spiders sliding down their threads,
so many that they pelted quick as rain-drops on the turf.
And, lo you! ’twas a rabble of Oberon’s courtiers tripping
across to set their mushroom tables in the shade retired
from the moon of night, and indeed, methought the Lady
Moon leaned her golden chin on a bar of cloud to watch the
silly shower and laugh at their follies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the voice of Mr. Herrick’s lute waxed faster and
faster till it spun a labyrinth of music wherein the fairies
did flout and spin and stagger, singing, and these words
reached me but no more:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And whether this was sung or danced I know not, for the
moon dipt behind a cloud, and all shapes from distinct became
confused into a swift murmur whether of sound or
sight or the ripple of the Dean Burn I can tell neither to
myself nor others, only that presently there was darkness and
silence. Nor can I say whether hours or minutes had past
when Mr. Herrick laid his hand upon my arm and roused
me from what I took to be a deep meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear guest,” says he, “you have slept long, and every
leaf is pearled in dew, and the Night would be secret with
her subjects. We intrude. Therefore rouse yourself, for
Mrs. Prue will think us strayed sheep if she wake, and indeed
I will bespeak your soft treading for she is but a crazy
sleeper and hath of late been sick, almost to be lunatic, with
a pain in her teeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was stumbling as if heavy with sleep and could say
naught, and so we crost the shining water on the stones and
returned wordless, and that night I slept like a happy spirit
in the dewy meads of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a word said the next day and Mr. Herrick almost distraught
with busyness for the riding post brought him letters
from his rich London kin and the news of growing troubles
between King and Parliament very piercing to his honest
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And on the day following my nag was saddled, and the
coach returning on its way to Exeter I was to ride with it
for security, but still not a word said on the matter nearest
my soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as we waited for the wheels,—I having bid Mrs.
Prue a kindly farewell with a vail which but ill compensated
her hospitable services, Mr. Herrick said musingly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, Mr. Tylliol, I made a verse on Dreams, in the
which this was writ:</p>

<p class='line0'>By dreams, each one into a several world.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I have read in ancient books that it is not impossible
but a man may be hurled into another man’s world or House
of Dreams—not often indeed but once in a great while.
And if this be so and it seems to that visitant a house of
lunacies or moonstruck madness (as well it may), shall there
be pardon for his dream-host therein?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, not a house of lunacies, but a house of enchantments
whereof I would I had the freehold! And if you had any
part in unlocking the door (whereof I know not what to
think) take my loving and humble thanks and again make
me welcome when leagues lie between us. For dreams ask
neither wheels nor hoofs to carry them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he smiling said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, lovingly we parted and the enchanted place grew small
and dim, receding behind me, and with fleshly eyes never
again shall I see the clear running of Dean Burn and the
lush meadows where fair Margery stroked me a syllabub of
cowslip cream. But Mr. Herrick shall I see, for his dreams
are not as other men’s and he comes, I know, sooner or later,
to London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now what all this means, I cannot know but may guess,
and on that I say no more. Let each man read it as he
can. But never again tell me that Mr. Herrick is a loose
liver because his Muse dwells like a dove in the warmth of
ladies’ bosoms, for I know better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jocund his Muse was, but his life was chaste,” is the
self-chosen Finis to his book, and well it may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for a last gift he slipt into my hand at parting his
latest verses or effusion to Madam Julia, whose stately pacing
haunts me yet and ever will.</p>

past as she went from lover to lover, faithful only to one, the
eternal sea. Colombo flames on you in the sun, hidden in
trees so deep, so green that if you climb a hill the town is
lost like a bird’s nest in the tangle of vegetation. And
what trees!—unlike the pensive elm and poplar, the ribbed
oak of the West, these burst into flowers and a spendthrift
fire of life. There is a giant covered with clusters of mauve
blossoms like the rhododendron—I could not leave it—I
was caught like a bee by its huge glory towering up into the
sunshine. It bathed every sense in delight to stand beneath
and see the larkspur blue of the sky through the crowded
bloom. Others more austerely beautiful with faint rose and
white crocus flowers springing from the grey stem and loading
the air with perfume, and for the background the grace
and grandeur of the palms balancing their frondure in the
blue. There are no words to describe these things. Only
in colour or music can their splendour be told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the lavish fruit! Mangosteens, mangoes, papayas,
oranges,—Aladdin’s jewels of wizard gardens. And the
jewels themselves, for Ratnapura, the City of Gems, is near
at hand. Moonstones heaped in great pearl-shells, like
silvery blue moonlight touched with swimming gleams of
gold, great cats’ eyes with oblique pupils, aqua-marines of
purest sparkling green, sea water dipped up from the secrecies
of deepest depths, wine-dark jargoons, tourmalines
many-hued as spring flowers, sapphires ranging from pale
azure to ocean blue, carbuncles that flame in ancient legends
as sacred jewels, all these and many more Ceylon displays
like the Queen she is. And the sea is as the jewels—all
light and glitter and the broken glories of rolling surf. It is
these things which have made her the desire of men’s eyes
from time immemorial—the Island of the blue horizon,
scarcely believable for beauty and wonder. Hear Abdulla,
called Wassaf, the poet of Siraf in Persia, when he wrote
of her long centuries ago:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Adam was driven forth from Paradise God made
a mountain of Ceylon the place of his descent, to break the
force of change and so assuage his fall. The charms of this
fair country, the softness of the air, are beyond all telling.
White amber is the dregs of its sea, and its indigo and red
bakam are cosmetics for beauty. The leaves, the barks,
and the sweating of its trees are cloves, spikenard, aloe
wood, camphor and fragrant mandel. Its icy water is a
ball of muneya for the fractures of the world. The
boundaries of its fields refresh the heart like the influence
of the stars. The margins of its regions are the bedfellows
of loveliness. Its myrobalums impart the blackness
of youthful hair, and its peppercorns put the mole on the
face of beauty on the fire of envy. Its rubies and carnelians
are like the lips and cheeks of charming girls, and its
treasures are as oceans full of polished gems. Indeed the
various birds are sweet singing parrots and the pheasants of
its gardens are graceful peacocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they told of her, and merchants came from the end of
the earth to trade in the wonders of Serendib, bringing and
taking riches, and not only riches but tales of wildest wonder
and romance. They said the people were descended
from a royal lion and hence their name Singhalese—Singha,
a lion. They said she breathed her sweetness for miles out
to sea and that before the shore rose from the horizon the
air was languid with her spices and perfumes. Was this
true or hyperbole? It is at least certain that in many parts
of the island the wild lemon grass is almost overwhelming in
its odour and many of the flowers scent all the world about
them. The tropical sun and hot dewy moisture stimulate
plant life into a passionate luxuriance of fragrant beauty.
Horror too, for there are blossoms whose name of Stercula
foetida tells all that need be told of their loathsomeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this strange land the sands of some of the rivers are
minute rubies and garnets, and it is of Serendib the story
was told of serpents that guarded the precious jacinths, and
the stratagem of the merchants in flinging pieces of meat
into deep valleys where they lay, that hovering eagles might
strike their talons in the meat encrusted with jewels and
carry it to their nests in the rocks, where ready hands could
seize it. The jacinths have become diamonds in the Arabian
Nights, but we all know the story in the mouth of Sindbad
the sailor of perilous seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the merchants had terrible tales to tell of the women
of the island. They were sirens as dangerous as ever sought
to beguile Ulysses. Some of them dwelt in a great city of
iron on the coast with fluttering signals on their towers to
lure sea-farers, and when the eager boats made for the shore
women of the most alluring loveliness, perfumed and garlanded,
ran to meet them, stretching passionate arms, wooing
them to enter the city. There they caressed them until
every sense was drowned in delight, when bound and helpless,
they flung them into iron cages and devoured them one
by one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchants were the great romancers of the ancient
world—the singers of songs, the tellers of tales, and surely
they had the right, for is there more romance in any word
than in their own name? It calls up mirage after mirage
of wearied camel caravans toiling through deserts of sand
to cities that were old when Balkh and Damascus were
young; where the blue and glittering domes of porcelain rise
against intenser skies in sunsets sonorous as a gong with
deep light and colour. It is the merchants always who carry
romance and adventure in their corded bales. In robe and
turban they yearn for the caravanserais and the men coming
by many ways to the meeting place. They hunger for the
flat hot cakes seed-sprinkled, and the savoury smells of the
kous-kous bubbling in oil, but most of all for the excitements
and lusts of the bazaar and the dangerous winding ways of
forbidden palaces. See them unroll the gold and flowered
stuffs of Bokhara, the silks from Cos as transparent as running
water that gave the fair Pamphila the glory of having
invented a dress “in which women were naked though
clothed.” See the muslins of Dacca unloosed from the
swaying camel-packs;—the merchants can scarcely handle
them lest a faint breeze blow them from their hold, for of
these it is told that the Emperor, Akbar, the Truth-Seeker,
rebuked a woman who appeared before him robed in woven
air, saying, “Little does it become a daughter of the Prophet
to show herself arrayed in one dress only and that, as it
were, nothing, being but the illusion of a garment.” And
she replied audaciously: “Majesty, Light of the Age, I am
more modest than modesty’s self, for I wear at this moment
<span class='it'>Nine</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through all the stories of Ceylon the merchants go,
tempting the perilous seas in frail dromonds and crank high-decked
galleons, tempted in turn by princesses, more perilous
than the seas, shooting dangerous glances through rose-coloured
veils. Sometimes their historic quests were wild as
any dream. It was rumoured over Asia that the lost Tree
of Life grew in the jungles of this fortunate Island and a
King of Persia and Emperor of China sent their merchants
with huge wealth to buy its precious leaves—more than ever
precious in the intrigues of Oriental Courts—but only to
find it grows in a Paradise more far away than even the
famed Serendib, and that no merchants, young and ardent,
grave and bearded, could lay that merchandise before the
throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ceylon figures in one of the most ancient epics of the
world—the Ramayana, for it was Ravana the demon King
of Ceylon (Lanka) who seized the lovely Sita, wife of the
God-King Rama as she wandered in the forest, and bore her
through the air to his island kingdom. The writer of the
poem was a mighty poem maker: Valmiki,—let his name
be fragrant for all time! And like all his divine brotherhood
he was first taught by sorrow. For sitting one day in
the heart of the woods, Valmiki beheld two herons singing
for joy and love as they wandered together by air and water,
and as he gladdened to their gladness, an archer shot the male
bird and he fell bathed in blood, never again to sweep the
wing-ways of the sky, and his mate fluttered about him in
agony. So Valmiki, with the wrath and power of a poet,
cursed the man who had done this black deed, and, as he
spoke, suddenly he knew that his words were a measured
music and that a new and wonderful thing had befallen in
the world. And so it was, for Brahma appeared in the
cloud, four-faced, majestic, and commanded him to write
the history of Rama and the storming of Ceylon in this
same mysterious music. “And it shall be true in every
word,” said the God, “and so long as the world lasts shall
this story be known among men.” And that was the beginning
of poetry in India.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps this is the chief fame of Ceylon, for the God
spoke not in vain. There is no city now so lovely as that of
which Valmiki tells—the city of jewelled pavements and
windows of glimmering crystal and the cloudy palaces where
the cruel King dwelt and where Sita was a captive. For—“Here
dwelt the fair princesses torn by him from vanquished
Kings. Now it was night and they lay overpowered with
wine and sleep. One had her head thrown backward; some
had their garlands crushed; some lay in each other’s bosoms,
or with arms interlaced, others in slumber deep as death.
The King Ravana lay on a dais apart made of crystal and
adorned with jewels. Here lay he overcome with wine, with
glittering rings in his ears and robed in gold, breathing like
a hissing serpent. Around him lay his sleeping Queens, and
nearest him the dearest, the golden-hued Mandodari.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the story runs through all its epic wonder of love and
war, and yearly in India is celebrated the harrying of
Ravana—I have seen his ten-headed image go up in flames
amid the rejoicing of a multitude. Yet, as I think, the
ancient city, Anaradhapura, now a ruin in the jungle, could
not have fallen so far behind the splendours of Valmiki.
Many who have visited it have written of it as it is in death—the
broken fragments of palaces and temples, a few preserved
here and there like rocks that are the survival of
some lost Atlantis in the drowning ocean of the forest.
How few recall it as it was in its pride and power! I stood
in the green dimness of the glades where are the sculptured
tanks where the queens bathed in days long dead, and read
the words of one who knew it well—Fa Hien, the Chinese
Buddhist pilgrim of the fourth century <span style='font-size:smaller'>A. D.</span> For this was
the Anaradhapura of the Ceylon he visited in search of the
words of the Lord Buddha; of himself he speaks in the third
person:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the north of the royal city is erected a great tower in
height 470 feet,—it is adorned with gold and silver and
perfected with every precious substance. There is by the
side of it a monastery containing 5000 priests. They also
have built here a hall of the Lord which is covered with gold
and silver engraved work. In the midst of this hall is a
jasper figure (of the Buddha) in height about 22 feet. The
entire body glitters and sparkles with the seven precious
substances. In the right hand he holds a pearl of inestimable
value. Fa Hien had been absent many years from
China; the manners and customs of these people were entirely
strange to him, moreover his fellow travellers were
now separated from him, for some had remained behind and
some were dead. All at once as he stood by this jasper
figure, he beheld a merchant present to it as a religious offering
a fan of white silk of Chinese manufacture. Unwittingly
Fa Hien gave way to his sorrowful feelings and the
tears flowed from his eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those tears, dried so long since, gave to this Western pilgrim,
standing in the same place, the true Virgilian sense
of tears in mortal things, and still they move the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ceylon is a land of the Gods. They have left their footprints
very plain upon this radiant loveliness as they came
and went. She has known many generations of them. All
who would understand her should read Valmiki’s semi-divine
poem of the great battles of Rama, God-King of India, as he
fought here his wars of the Gods and Titans to rescue his
wife, the lovely Sita, the heart’s love and worship to this day
of his dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, when the Demon King held her in captivity,
the army of Rama strode across the bridge of scattered
rocks between Ceylon and India. Still may be seen the gap
that no strength, human or divine, could pass, where the
mighty host was stayed, until a little tree squirrel, for love
of Rama, laid his small body in the hollow, and because love
is the bridge eternal between the two worlds, the rescuing
host passed triumphant over it. But Rama, stooping
from his Godhead, Incarnation as he was in human flesh
of Vishnu the Preserver, lifted the crushed body tenderly
and touched the dead fur, and to this day, the tree squirrels
bear the marks of the divine fingers upon their coats of grey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no demarcation in Asia between the so-called
animal and human lives. Rama himself had passed through
the animal experience on the upward way and knew well
what beats in the little heart beneath fur and feather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those wonderful parables, the Birth Stories of the Lord
Buddha, are recorded his supposed memories of the incarnations
of bird, animal and other lives through which a
steadfast evolution led him to the Ten Perfections. How
should he not know, and knowing love? Is it not written by
a great Buddhist saint: “It may well be that to the eye of
flesh, plants and trees appear to be gross matter; but to the
eye of the Buddha they are composed of minute spiritual
particles; grass, trees, countries the earth itself, shall enter
wholly into Buddhahood”? And does not science, faltering
far behind the wisdom of the mighty, adumbrate these
truths in its later revelations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know too little of the wisdom of the East. The Magi
still journey to Bethlehem, but only those who have the
heart of the Child may receive their gold, myrrh, and frankincense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, for mere beauty’s sake, these stories of the East
should be read. Men thrill to the mighty thunder-roll of
Homer’s verse, but the two supreme epics of India are little
known. If the West would gather about the story-teller as
the East gathers, in bazaar or temple court, the stories should
be told from these and other sources, until Rama stands beside
the knightly Hector, and Sita’s star is set in the same
heaven where shines the lonely splendour of Antigone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the rapturous peace of the Lord Buddha could no
longer be contained within the heart of India, it overflowed,
and like a rising tide submerged Ceylon. And now, although
India has forgotten and has returned to the more
ancient faiths, Ceylon remembers. The Lotus of the Good
Law blossoms in every forest pool. The invocation to the
Jewel in the Lotus is daily heard from every monastery of
the Faith, where the yellow-robed Brethren still follow the
way marked for them by the Blessed One who in Uruvela
attained to that supernal enlightenment of which he said,
“And that deep knowledge have I made my own—that
knowledge, hard to perceive, hard to understand, peace-giving,
not to be gained by mere reason, which is deeper
than the depths, and accessible only to the wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, among living men are some whose eyes are but a
little darkened with dust. To them shall the truth be manifest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it be an aim of travel to see what is beautiful and
strange, it may be also an aim to seek that spiritual beauty
where it sits enthroned in its own high places; and my hope
in Ceylon was to visit the land where that strait and narrow
way of Buddhism is held which is known as the Hinayana—or
the Lesser Vehicle. In Tibet, China, and Japan,
I had known the efflorescence of the Buddhist Faith where,
recognizing the mystic emanations of the Buddhas, it becomes
the Greater Vehicle and breaks into gorgeous ritual
and symbolism, extraordinarily beautiful in themselves, and
yet more so in their teaching. Buddhism, in those countries,
like the Bride of the Canticles, goes beautifully in jewels
of gold and raiment of fine needlework, within her ivory
palaces. In Ceylon, like the Lady Poverty of Saint Francis
of Assisi, she walks with bared feet, bowed head, her
begging-bowl in hand, simple and austere in the yellow robe
of the Master—her rock-temples and shrines as he himself
might have blessed them in their stern humility. Save at
the Temple of the Tooth, the splendours she heaps upon his
altars are those of her flowers. With these she may be lavish
because his life was wreathed with their beauty. He
was born in a garden, beneath a Tree he attained Wisdom,
in a garden he died. A faith that is held by nearly every
tenth living man or woman is surely worthy of reverence and
study, even in these hurrying days when gold, not wisdom,
is the measure of attainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I came to Ceylon for the first time but not for the last.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Near a little town in the hills stands a Wihara—a monastery—dreaming
in the silent sunshine. The palms are
grouped close about the simple roofs—so close that the passing
tourist could never guess that the Head of the Buddhist
Faith in Ceylon, a great saint, a great ruler of seven thousand
priests, dwelt there in so secret, so complete an austerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a very old man when I came, but his ninety-two
years sat lightly on him and each year had laid its tribute of
love and honour at his feet. He was known as the Maha
Nayaka Thero; and in religion, for the love of the Master,
he had taken the Master’s human name of Siddartha. It
was strange indeed to see the simplicity of his surroundings;—to
me it appeared singularly beautiful: it breathed
the spiritual purity that had made him beloved throughout
the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great scholar, deeply learned in Sanskrit and Pali and
in the abtruse philosophy that is for the elders of the Law,
he was yet the gentlest of men, and his very learning and
strength were all fused into a benignant radiance that sunned
the griefs of the world he had cast so far behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was glad to wander about in the quiet monastery—the
little one-storied quadrangle on the side of the hill. It offered—it
invited—the life of meditation, of clear thought,
of delicate austerity. The noise of great events (so-called)
was like the dim murmur of a shell when they reached the
Wihara and the ear of Sri Siddartha. But he heard, he
noted the progress of science, even to the possibilities of
aviation, because to a Buddhist saint all spheres of knowledge
are one, and all nothing, in the Ocean of Omniscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the people brought their grievances and troubles to
the aged Archbishop. You were in the presence of a very
great gentleman when you entered and found him seated, his
scribe cross-legged at his feet to record what passed. The
people would approach him softly and with the deepest reverence,
and with permission would seat themselves on the
ground at a due distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Venerable Sir, we are in trouble. We seek your counsel.”
That was the cry. And always, in spite of his many years,
he listened and counselled and comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after my arrival his birthday was celebrated with
much rejoicing. The Bhikkus (monks) had put up little
festive bamboo arches, fluttering with split palm-leaves like
ribbons, all about the Wihara, and troops of Bhikkus came
to lay their homage at his feet. The roads were sunshiny
with their yellow robes as they flocked in from remote
places—jungle, cave-temples, and far mountains. The
laity came also, crowding to see the Venerable One. He received
them all with serene joy, and pursued his quiet way,
thinking, reading, meditating on the Three Jewels—the
Lord, the Law, and the Communion of Saints. And the
Bhikkus departed, believing that he might be among them
for many days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not to be; for, a few days later, while he was
sweeping the garden walks, a duty he had made his own, he
felt a sudden loss of strength, and lying down, in two hours
he passed painlessly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was permitted to visit Sri Siddartha as he lay in death.
The room was very simple and bare. Many of his Bhikkus
stood about him, and there were flowers, flowers, everywhere.
Beside him burned a perfumed gum, sending up its
thin blue spirals of fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was received with perfect kindness, and especially
by his favourite disciple and pupil—a young monk with a
worn ascetic face, who stood in deep meditation at the head
of his Master. He looked up and smiled, and raised the
face-cloth that I might see, and looked down again at the
brown face, calm as a mask of Wisdom with its closed lips
and eyes. Even closed, they looked old—old. A Bhikku,
standing by, told me that all had loved him and were bereaved
in his going. “But for him—he is in the Nirvana of
Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strange phrase awoke in my mind the words of the
Blessed One, and I repeated them as I stood beside that
quiet sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this, O Bhikkus, is the highest, this is the holiest
wisdom—to know that all suffering has vanished away.
He has found the true deliverance that lies beyond the
reach of change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I remembered the symbolic fresco in Colombo, representing
the Lord Buddha borne dead on a chariot in a
garden. The gardener digs his grave, but the Lord awakes
from death, and bids the man know he is not dead but living.
The Buddha stands majestic by the open grave—the
gardener recoils in fear. Death has no more dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I left Sri Siddartha lying in the mystery where all the
wisdoms are one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the garden, in the riot of tropical blossom and beauty,
a Bhikku was standing in the perfect stillness that is a part
of the discipline. He greeted me, and we spoke of my
quest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” he said, “to Mihintale, where the Law first came to
this island by the hands of Mahinda. Seek also the great
Dagoba where stand the images of the Buddhas that have
been and of Him who is to come. And under the Tree
which is a part of that Tree beneath which the Blessed One
received illumination, meditate on Truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I delayed only that I might see the flames receive the discarded
body of the Venerable One; and the ceremony took
place next day, amid a vast gathering of the people and the
great companies of the Bhikkus. They flooded the ways
with sunshine in every shade of yellow, from deep primrose
to a tawny orange. The roads were strewn, with rice like
snowflakes, stamped into star-shapes. A strange melancholy
music went with us. So, climbing a steep hill, we
came to the pyre, heaped with the scented and aromatic
woods of the jungle, and closed from human view by a
high scaffolding draped with bright colours. On this pyre
he was laid, and one of his own blood, holding a torch, applied
the pure element to the wood: and, as he did so, the
assembly raised a cry of “Sadhu, Sadhu!” and with that
ascription of holiness a sheet of flame swept up into the
crowns of the palms, and the scent of spices filled the air.
And even as the body of the Blessed One passed into grey
ash, passed also the worn-out dwelling of Sri Siddartha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made my way next day to a temple hollowed in the
rock, the ceiling of which is frescoed with gods and heroes.
It is taught that here the Canon of the Buddhist Scriptures
was first committed to writing about 450 <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> Here five
hundred, priests, learned in the Faith, assembled, and collating
the Scriptures, chanted every word, while the scribes
recorded them with stylus and palm-leaf as they heard.
Burmese, Tibetans, Indians, all were present, that so the
Law might be carried over Asia, and the Peace of the
Blessed One be made known to men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, too, the discipline was fixed. The Bhikku must
not be touched by a woman’s hand. He must eat but
twice a day, and not after noon. He must keep the rule of
the Lady Poverty as did Saint Francis. He must sleep nowhere
but in Wiharas and other appointed places. And
these are but a few of the commands. Yet, if the rule is
too hard for him, the Bhikku may relinquish it at his will,
and return to the world a free man—a fettered man, as the
Master would have said, but free according to the rule of
the Transient World. It is said that few accept this permission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took little imagination to people the silent temple with
the Assembly—the keen intellectual Indian faces, the yellow
robe and the bared shoulder, seated in close ranks in the
twilight of the temple. Now it was silent and empty, but
a mysterious aura filled it. The buildings of men’s hands
pass away, but the rock, worn not at all, save where feet
come and go, preserves the aspect of its great day, when it
was the fountain-head of Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A solemn gladness filled the air. Surely the West is waking
to the message of the East—that message, flowing
through the marvellous art of China and Japan, through the
deep philosophies of India, the great Scriptures of the Buddhist
Faith, and many more such channels. And we who
have entered the many mansions through another gate may
share and rejoice in the truths that are a world-heritage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was time now that I should visit the holy places, and I
took the road through the jungle, intending to stay at the
little rest-houses which exist to shelter travellers. The way
is green with grass in the middle; there are two tracks for
wheels—narrow and little used. Even the native huts may
sometimes be forty miles apart. And on either side runs
the huge wall of the jungle, holding its secret well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great trees, knotted with vines and dark with heavy undergrowth,
shut me in. Sometimes a troop of silver-grey
monkeys swept chattering overhead; sometimes a few red
deer would cross the road, or a blue shrike flutter radiantly
from one shelter to another. Mostly, the jungle was silent
as the grave, but living, breathing, a vast and terrible personality;
an ocean, and with the same illimitable might
and majesty. Travelling through it, I was as a fish that
swims through the green depths of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I journeyed in a little bullock cart—and suddenly,
abruptly, as if dropped from heaven, sprang out of the
ocean of the jungle that bathed its feet a huge cube of rock
nearly five hundred feet high, with lesser rocks spilt about it
that would have been gigantic were it not for the first—the
famous Sigurya.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An ancient people, led by a parricide king, took this
strange place and made of it a mighty fortress. They cut
galleries in the living rock that, like ants, they might pass
up and down unharmed from below; and on the head of
the rock—a space four acres in extent—they set a king’s
palace and pleasance, with a bathing-tank to cool the torrid
air. Then, still desiring beauty, this people frescoed
the sheer planes of this precipitous rock of Sigurya with pictures
that modern Singhalese art cannot rival. These vast
pictures represent a procession of ladies to a shrine, with
attendants bearing offerings. Only from the waist upward
are the figures visible; they rise from clouds as if floating in
the sky. The faces have an archaic beauty and dignity.
One, a queen, crowned and bare-bosomed, followed by attendants
bearing stiff lotus blooms, is beautiful indeed, but
in no Singhalese or Indian fashion—a face dark, exotic, and
heavy-lidded, like a pale orchid. It is believed the whole
rock was thus frescoed into a picture-gallery, but time and
weather have taken toll of the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Government has put steps and climbing rails, that
the height may be reached. Half-way up is a natural level,
and above it soars the remainder of the citadel, to be climbed
only by notches cut in the rock, and hand-rails as a safeguard
from the sheer fall below. And here this dead people
had done a wonderful thing. They had built a lion of
brick, so colossal that the head towered to the full height of
the ascent. It has fallen into ruin, but the great cat-paws
that remain indicate a beast some two hundred feet high.
There is a gate between the paws, and in the old days they
clambered up through the body of the lion and finally
through his throat, into the daylight of the top. Only the
paws are left, complete even to the little cat-claw at the
back of each. Surely one of the strangest approaches in
the world! Here and there the shelving of the rock overhangs
the ascent, and drops of water fall in a bright crystal
rain perpetually over the jungle so far below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing upon the height, it was weirdly lovely to see the
eternal jungle monotonously swaying and waving beneath.
I thought of the strange feet that had followed these ways,
with hopes and fears so like our own. And now their fortress
is but a sunny day’s amusement for travellers from
lands unknown, and the city sitteth desolate, and the strength
of their building is resumed into the heart of nature. But
the places where men have worshipped and lifted their hands
to the Infinite are never dead. The Spirit that is Life Eternal
hovers about them, and the green that binds their broken
pillars is the green of an immortal hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening was now at hand, and, after the sun-steeped
day, the jungle gave out its good smells, beautiful earth-warm
smells like a Nature-Goddess, rising from the vast
tangle of life in the mysterious depths. You may gather
the flowers on their edge and wonder what the inmost flowers
are like that you will never see—rich, labyrinthine, beyond
all thought to paint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jungle is terrible as an army with banners. Sleeping
in the little rest-house when the night has fallen, it
comes close up to you, creeping, leaning over you, calling,
whispering, vibrating with secret life. A word more,—only
one,—a movement, and you would know the meaning and
be gathered into the heart of it; but always there is something
fine, impalpable, between, and you catch but a breath
of the whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very wonderful is the jungle! In the moonlight of a
small clearing I saw the huge bulk of three wild elephants
feeding. They vanished like wraiths into the depths. The
fireflies were hosting in the air like flitting diamonds.
Stealthy life and movement were about me: the jungle, wide-awake
and aware, moving on its own occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later I was at Anaradhapura. Once a million
people dwelt in the teeming city. Here or near was
the site visited by the famous Chinese pilgrim already mentioned,
Fa Hien. But it is in ruins; the jasper image is
gone. The tower is in the dust. A few priests watch by
the scene of so much dead greatness and receive the pilgrims
who still come with bowed heads to the Holy Places.
But Fa Hien has reached the home of all the pilgrimages—the
City of God dear and desirable in the sight of Plato
and Saint Augustine, and all the warriors of all the faiths,
and the inexorable years that have devoured the splendours
of the Kings leave untouched his tears and his hope, for
both are rooted in immortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He writes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The houses of the merchants are very beautifully
adorned. The streets are smooth and level. At this time
the King, being an earnest believer in the Law, desired to
build a new monastery for this congregation. He chose a
pair of strong oxen and adorned their horns with gold, silver
and precious things. Then providing himself with a
beautiful gilded plough, the King himself ploughed round
the four sides of the allotted space, after which, ceding all
personal rights, he presented the whole to the priests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This must be the monastery described by a later pilgrim,
Hieuen Tsang, who journeyed from China to India about
the year 630 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span> In visiting Ceylon, he writes of its magnificence
and especially of an upright pole on the roof “on
which is fixed a mighty ruby. This gem constantly sheds
a brilliant light which is visible day and night for a long
distance and afar off appears like a bright star.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That too is quenched in the dust. Where do the great
jewels of antiquity hide? But one is left at Anaradhapura
more precious than rubies—the famous image of the Buddha
seated alone in a forest glade, the true presentment of a
God, to whom beneath his closed eyes eternity is visible and
time the shadow of a dream. Around him surged once
the clamour of a great city, around him now the growth of
the forest, both to his vision alike—and nothing. Some
wayfarer had laid a flower at his feet when I stood there,
and a white tassel of the areca palm. The sun and moon
circle before him in this lonely place and the centuries pass
like seasons.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>The place is a village lost in the woods, but inexpressibly
holy because it contains in its own temple the sacred Bodhi
Tree which is an offshoot of that very Tree beneath which
the Lord Buddha received the Perfect Wisdom. Ceylon
desired this treasure, and they tried to break a branch from
the Tree, but dared not, for it resisted the sacrilege. But
the Princess Sanghamitta, in great awe and with trembling
hand, drew a line of vermilion about the bough, and at that
line it separated from the Tree, and the Princess planted it
in perfumed earth in a golden vase, and so brought it, attended
by honours human and superhuman, to Ceylon—to
this place, where it still stands. It is believed to be 2230
years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With infinite reverence I was given two leaves, collected
as they fell; and it is difficult to look on them unmoved if
indeed this Tree be directly descended from the other, which
sheltered the triumphant conflict with evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city itself is drowned in the jungle. In the green
twilight you meet a queen’s palace, with reeling pillars and
fallen capitals, beautiful with carved moonstones, for so
are called the steps of ascent. Or lost in tangle, a manger
fifty feet long for the royal elephants, or a nobly planned
bath for the queens, where it is but to close the eyes and
dream that dead loveliness floating in the waters once so
jealously guarded, now mirroring the wild woodways. A
little creeper is stronger than all our strength, and our armies
are as nothing before the silent legions of the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, I stood before the image of that Buddha who is
to come—who in the Unchanging awaits his hour; Maitreya,
the Buddha of Love. A majestic figure, robed like a king,
for he will be royal. In his face, calm as the Sphinx, must
the world decipher its hope, if it may. Strangely enough, in
most of his images this Saviour who shall come is seated like
a man of the West, and many learned in the faith believe
that this Morning Star shall rise in the West. May he come
quickly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I set out one day for Mihintale, in a world of dewy, virginal
loveliness, washed with morning gold, the sun shooting
bright arrows into the green shade of the trees, a cloud
of butterflies radiant as little flower angels going with me.
One splendour, rose-red, velvet-black, alighted with quivering
wings on the mouse-grey shoulder of the meek little bull
who drew my cart and so went with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was glad that my companion should be a devout Buddhist,
for his reverence and delight in the beauty of his
faith taught me many things. We climbed up through trees
so still that the rustling of their shadows on the ground
might have been audible, and as we went he told me a very
ancient Buddhist story which must have reached the Island
with the Apostle Mahinda, son of the high Emperor
Ashoka, who brought the faith from his father’s court in
India. Ashoka is one of the great world-rulers, the Constantine
of the Buddhist teaching and himself a devout disciple.
This story is a Jataka or Birth Story of the Lord, one of
those to which I have already alluded, as conveying moral
teaching (and often much folk lore), and this is called “The
Dancing Peacock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus have I heard. In the old days the Blessed Buddha
sat at Jetavana, and they told him of a monk who had become
drowned in luxury, eating, drinking and adorning his
person with magnificence, so that he cared nothing for the
faith. And at last they brought him before the Lord that
he might be admonished. And the Perfect One said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is it true, monk, that despising all nobility you have
surrendered yourself to idle luxury?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And without waiting to hear a word more the monk flew
into a violent anger, and tearing off his magnificent robe he
stood naked before the Master, crying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then, if you like not my robes, this is the way I will go
about!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the bystanding monks cried out: ‘Shame, Shame!’
and in a fury he rushed from the hall and returned to the
condition of a layman. And the Lord said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not only now, O monks, has this man lost the Jewel of
the faith by immodesty but it was also with him in a former
life. Hear the story of the Dancing Peacock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very long ago in the first age of the world, the birds
chose the Golden Bird to be their King. Now the Golden
Bird had a daughter, most beautiful to see, and he gave her
her choice of a husband, after the ancient manner of India,
calling together all the birds of the Himalaya. And he sent
for his daughter, saying: “Now come and choose!” And
looking she saw the Peacock with a neck of gold and emeralds
and a train of spread jewels, and instantly she said:
“Let this be my husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So all the birds approached the Peacock, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Noble Peacock, the Princess has set her heart upon you.
Therefore rejoice with humility.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the Peacock, walking arrogantly, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Up to this day none of you would recognize the greatness
that was in me. Now instantly do homage to my majesty!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so intoxicated was he with pride that he began to
dance, spreading his wings and swaying his head, and altogether
conducting himself like a drunken man who cares
not at all for decency. And horror seized the Golden Bird
and he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘This fellow has broken loose from all sense of shame—how
could it be that I should give my Princess to such as
he?’ And he uttered this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Pleasant is your cry. Jewelled is your back. The
feathers of your tail are glorious, but, Sir, to such a dancer,
I can give no daughter of mine!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he bestowed his Princess immediately upon a bird of
modest behaviour, and the Peacock, covered with shame,
fled away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore, brethren, this monk has now lost the Jewel
of the faith as he once lost a fair wife. For in a former
birth, the Peacock was this shameless monk, but I myself
was the Golden Bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is a lesson also upon the stately calm which
marks the gentleman according to Oriental opinion. It is
the low-born only who may hurry and storm. Other stories
I heard, for my friend was a student of ancient things, and
this belief in lives past and to come is the spiritual life blood
of the Orient. It is the mete-yard of justice. He asked
me whether the Christian faith explicitly denied it, and I
could only reply—No; quoting that strange passage of
the Blind Man, when disciples questioning the Christ—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did this man sin or his parents, that he was born blind?”—pass
unrebuked for the implication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hill of Mihintale rises abruptly as Sigurya from the
forests, and the very air about it is holy, for it was on this
great hill that Mahinda, mysteriously transported from
India, alighted bewildered as one waking from a dream.
Here the King, Tissa, seeing the saint seated beneath a tree,
heard a voice he could not gainsay that called his name
three times; and so, approaching with his nobles, he received
the Teaching of the Blessed One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hill is climbed by wonderful carved shallow steps,
broken now, and most beautiful with an overgrowth of
green. At the sides are beds of the Sensitive Plant, with its
frail pink flowers. They would faint and fall if touched,
and here you would not even breathe roughly upon them, for
Buddhists regard the shrinking creatures as living and hold
it sinful to cause such evident suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Descending the grey steps, the shade and sunshine dappling
his yellow robe and bared shoulder with noble colour,
came a priest, on his way to visit the sick of the little village.
He stopped and spoke. I told him I had come from
visiting the shrines of Burma, and he desired me to give
him a description of some matters I had seen there. I did
so, and we talked for some time, and it was then mentioned
that my food, like his own, necessitated no taking of life.
Instantly his whole face softened as he said that was glad
news to hear. It was the fulfilling of a high commandment.
Would I receive his blessing, and his prayer that the truth
might enlighten me in all things? He bestowed both, and,
having made his gift, went upon his way with the dignity
of perfect serenity. That little circumstance of food (as
some would call it) has opened many a closed door to me
in Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top of the hill is a deep shadowy rock-pool, with a
brow of cliff overhanging it; and this is named the Cobra’s
Bath, for it is believed that in the past there was a cobra
who used, with his outspread hood, to shelter the saint, Mahinda,
from the torrid sun, and who was also so much a little
servant of the Law that none feared and all mourned him
when he passed upon his upward way in the chain of existences.
Here, above the pool where he loved to lie in the
clear cool, they sculptured a great cobra, with three hooded
heads, rising, as it were, from the water. It was most sinuously
beautiful and looked like the work of a great and
ancient people, gathering the very emblem of Fear into the
great Peace. On the topmost height was the <span class='it'>stupa</span>, or
shrine, of Mahinda, incasing its holy relic, and the caves
where his priests dwelt and still dwell. I entered one, at
the invitation of a Bhikku, an old man with singularly beautiful
eyes, set in a face of wistful delicacy. He touched my
engraved ring and asked what it might mean. Little enough
to such as he, whose minds are winged things and flutter
in the blue tranquillities far above the earth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The caves are many, with a rock-roof so low that one
cannot stand upright—a strange, dim life, it would seem,
but this Bhikku spoke only of the peace of it, the calm that
falls with sunset and that each dawn renews. <span class='it'>I</span> could not
doubt this—it was written upon his every gesture. He gave
me his blessing, and his prayer that I might walk forever in
the Way of Peace. With such friends as these the soul
is at home. Peace. It is indeed the salutation of Asia,
which does not greet you with a desire for health or prosperity
as in the West, but only—Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would willingly tell more of my seekings and findings in
Ceylon, for they were many and great. But I pass on to
the little drowsy hill town of Badulla, where the small bungalows
nest in their gardens of glorious flowers and vines. I
sat in the churchyard, where the quiet graves of English
and Singhalese are sinking peacefully into oblivion. It was
Sunday, with a Sabbath calm upon the world. A winding
path led up to the open door of the little English church, a
sweet breeze swayed the boughs and ruffled the long grass of
the graves; the butterflies, small Psyches fluttered their
parable in the air about me. A clear voice from the church
repeated the Lord’s Prayer, and many young voices followed.
It was a service for the Singhalese children
who have been baptized into the Christian Faith. They
sang of how they had been brought out of darkness and
the shadow of death and their feet set upon the Way of
Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely it is so. When was that Way closed to any who
sought? But because man must follow his own categorical
imperative, I repeated to myself, when they were silent, the
words of the poet Abdul Fazl, which he wrote at the command
of the Emperor Akbar as an inscription for a Temple
in Kashmir:—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“O God, in every temple I see people that see Thee, and in
every language they praise Thee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it be a mosque, men murmur the holy prayer, and if it be a
Christian church they ring the bell from love to Thee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes I frequent the Christian cloister, and sometimes the
mosque, but it is Thou whom I seek from temple to temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thine elect have no dealings with heresy or orthodoxy, for
neither of these stands behind the screen of thy Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heresy to the heretic and religion to the orthodox!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dust of the rose-petal belongs to the heart of the
perfume-seller!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Yes,—and an ancient Japanese poet, going yet deeper,
says this thing: “So long as the mind of a man is in accord
with the Truth, the Gods will hear him though he do
not pray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I passed the night at a little rest-house and next day set
out on the long journey to Polonnarewa, and beyond that to
Trincomali, through a wild part of Ceylon, stopping each
night at the rest-houses which mark the way. Jungle in
India is often mere scrub; this is thousands of acres of
mighty forest. A small road has been driven through it,
and on either side rises the dark and secret wall of trees, impenetrable
for miles, knitted with creepers and blind with
undergrowth—a dangerous mystery.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Thousand eyeballs under hoods,</p>
<p class='line0'>Have you by the hair.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>It seems that every movement is watched, that strained ears
listen to every breath from the secrecy that can never be
pierced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much farther on the forest opens into the ancient tank
of Minneri, for these great artificial lakes of the bygone
Kings here and in India are called tanks. It is a glorious
lake twenty miles in circumference and I saw it first with
the mountains, exquisite in form and colour, rising behind it
in the rose and gold of a great sunset. Some forgotten King
made it to water the country, and there are still the very
sluices unbroken though choked by masses of fallen masonry.
It is the work of great engineers. No place could
be more lovely—the silver fish leaping in translucent water,
and one pouched pelican with its ax-like beak drifting
lazily in a glory so dazzling, that one could only glimpse it a
moment in the dipping sparkles of the reflected sun. The
way, like the ascent to Mihintale, was banked with masses
of the Sensitive Plant, lovely with its fragile pink flowers and
delicately folding and dropping leaves, fainting as you brush
them in passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the lake—the wide expanse, calm as heaven and a
shimmer of rose and blue and gold! I lingered to watch
it—the strange beautiful grotesque of the great bird floating
above its own perfect image. It was evening and the
jungle was sweet with all the scents drawn out of it during
the long sun-steeped day—heavenly scents that come from
the teeming life in the mysterious forests, fresh forests germinating
on the ruins of the old—murmuring, calling, vibrating
with life and wonder and strange existences, and
their endless chain of blossom and decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It grew dark soon after Minneri, and the fireflies were glittering
about us and the moonlight white on the narrow way.
A whispering silence filled the air with unseen presences
as of the feet that long, long centuries ago trod this way on
their errands of pleasure or pain to the dead city of my goal.
I could almost see its spectral towers and palaces down the
moon-blanched glades. Illusion—nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver missed the track to Polonnarewa, but that mattered
little, so wonderful was the night in the lonely place
and the great dark where once a mighty people moved, and
now but the moon and stars circle before a dead majesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the long last we found our way and the little rest-house
which stands where stood the royal city, near a dim
glimmer of water. The only accommodation was a chair,
but that was welcome, and when I woke in the grey dawn
she came gliding with silver feet over the loveliest lake rippling
up to the steps of the fairy house in the woods, and
peopled by the glorious rose lotus, grown by the ancient people
for the service of the Temples. And the traveller whom
I met there went out before breakfast and brought in for
provender a pea-hen, a wood pigeon, and a great grey fish
from the lake. For myself, I eat like a Buddhist priest
and am content,—living foods were not for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ruins at Polonnarewa are wonderful indeed, much
more perfect than those of the better known Anaradhapura,
though it does not offer, like the latter, the marvellous row
of the Buddhas who have fulfilled their mission and that
Buddha of Love who is yet to come. All about are temples
with colossal Buddhas, palaces, the strangely sculptured
stone rails which are so distinctively Buddhist surrounding
richly carved shrines. Hinduism mingled with Buddhism
also. Some of these beautiful relics have been dug out of
the jungle strata, some reclaimed from the invading growths
which are so all-obliterating in a tropic country, and no
doubt there is as much more to be discovered. The carved
work is exquisitely lovely. How strong is the passion for
beauty—in the very ends of the earth it is found, and surely
it confirms the Platonic teaching that it is a reflection of
that passion of joy in which the Creator beheld his work on
the seventh day and knew that it was good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot describe the wonder of passing through these
glades and lawns and seeing the great dagobas, those mighty
buildings of brick, but now waving with greenery, enshrining
each its holy relic. Would that it were possible to imagine
the city which dwelt under their shadow! But the
homes of men pass very swiftly away. It is only the homes
of their souls which abide. Yet the jungle is more wonderful
than what it buries. The sunlit walls of green guard
the road jealously. The sun-flecks only struggle a few
inches within that line, and then—trackless secrecy. A
bird flew out, jewelled, gorgeous, “Half angel and half bird.”
Are there greater wonders within? Who can tell? It is
sometimes death to attempt to lift the veil of Isis. I saw
the gravestone of a young man who for all his strength and
youth was lost in the jungle—caught in the poisoned sweetness
of her embrace and so died. It may have been a lonely
and fearful death, and yet again—who knows! There are
compensations of which we know nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stayed at the little rest-house of Kantelai on its lake
with the jungle creeping and whispering about it— “Dark
mother ever gliding near with soft feet.” Days to be remembered—unspeakably
beautiful—they leave some precious
deposit in the memory almost more lovely than the sight
itself, as in the world of thought the spirit is more than the
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for the end to my journey the great and noble harbour
of Trincomali! I wonder why tourists so seldom go
there, but the ways of the tourist pass understanding. It
winds about in lakes of sea blue among palms and coral
bights and glittering beaches. Long ago, the people drifting
over from India built a temple where the old fort now
stands, and though thus polluted the site is still holy and
you may see the Brahman priest cast offerings into the sea
from a ledge high up the cliff, with the worshipping people
about him. Then the Portuguese swept down upon Ceylon
in their great naval days when they were the Sweepers of the
Sea, and they destroyed the temple and built their fort.
And the Dutch followed, and the Portuguese vanished, and
the French conquered the Dutch, and again the Dutch the
French, and then the English, hawking over the Seven Seas,
pounced like the osprey, and the Dutch sovereignty passed
into their keeping. Did I not say the Island had many
masters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the English made this a great fortified place, humming
with naval and military activity; men-of-war lying in the
bay, guns bristling in the beautiful old fort that guards the
cliff. And now all that too is gone—blown away like a
wreath of mist, and the only soldiers and sailors are those
who will stay forever in the little grave-place under the
palms, and if it so continues I daresay the jungle will take
Trincomali as it has taken the City of Kings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful place. I wandered on the beach among the
shells one marvelled to see as a child, when sailor friends
gave them into eager hands—deep brown freckled polished
things, leopard-spotted and ivory-lipped, and so smooth that
the hand slips off the perfect surface. Delicate frailties of
opal and pearl shimmering with mystic colour, spiny grotesques
with long thorned stems—there they all lay for the
gathering. And at last I went up into the old fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It covers many acres on the cliff and the jungle is steadily
conquering the empty bungalows and fortifications. It is
very old, for the Dutch built it in 1650. Now in the thickets
the forsaken guns make an empty bravado like toothless
lions. I saw a deer and her fawn come peering shyly
through the bushes, and they fled before me. The casements
are empty and a flagless flagstaff looks over the
heavenly calm of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost lost in the shade I found some old Dutch graves,
very square and formal—a something of the rigidity of the
burgomaster about them still, as of stiff-ruffed men and
women. “Here sleeps in God—” said one mossy inscription
(but in Dutch)—and then a break, and then “Johanna”
and another break, and only a word here and there and a
long obliterated date. And the Dutch were masters and
Johanna slept in the ground of her people as securely as if
it had been The Hague itself. So it must then have seemed.
And now it is English, and whose next? Truly the fashion
of this world passeth away! They were touching, those
old tombs, with inscriptions that once were watered with
tears, that no one now cares to decipher. And there they
lie forgotten in the sighing trees, and the world goes by.
The dominion of oblivion is secure, whatever that of death
may be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I climbed down to a casement in the cliff, half-way to the
sea, a little shelf overlooking the blue transparence that met
the blue horizon, and wondered what the grave God-fearing
talk of the Dutchmen had been as they leaned over the parapet,
discussing the ways of the heathen and the encroachments
of the British. And from there I made my way to
the rocks below with the brilliant water heaving about them.
Some large fish of the most perfect forget-me-not blue shading
into periwinkle mauve on the fins were playing before
me, and as they rolled over, or a ripple took them they displayed
the underside, a faint rose pink. Such beautiful
happy creatures in the wash of the wandering water clear
and liquid as light! Sometimes they wavered like moons
under a ripple, a blot of heavenliest blue, submerged and
quivering, sometimes a shoal of black fish barred with gold
swam in among them, beautiful to see. I could have stayed
all day, for it was heavenly cool, with a soft sea breeze blowing
through the rocks, but even as I watched a great brown
monster came wallowing through the water, and my beauties
fled like swallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The touch of tragedy was not wanting, for high on the
cliff was a little pillar to the memory of a Dutch girl who
fell in love long ago with an Englishman—a false lover, who
sailed away and left her heartbroken. Here she watched his
sails lessening along the sky, and as they dipped below the
horizon, she threw herself over the cliff in unendurable
anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tragic story, but it is all so long ago that it has fallen
back into the beauty of nature and is now no more sad than
a sunset that casts its melancholy glory before it fades.
Yet I wonder whether in all the hide and seek of rebirth she
has caught up somewhere with her Englishman! She knows
all about Psyche’s wings by this time, and he too must have
gained a dear-bought wisdom through “the great mercy of
the gift of departing,” as the Buddhists call it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they to
whom death is so small an episode in so long a story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat by the pillar and watched the dying torch of the
sunset extinguished in the sea—a sea of glass mingled with
fire. And very quietly the stars appeared one by one in a
violet sky and it was night.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:10em;font-size:1.2em;'>THE WONDERFUL PILGRIMAGE TO AMARNATH</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>THE WONDERFUL PILGRIMAGE TO AMARNATH</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In all India there is nothing more wonderful than the pilgrimages
of millions, which set like tidal waves at certain
seasons to certain sacrosanct places—the throngs that
flock to holy Benares, to Hardwar, and to that meeting of
the waters at Prayag, where the lustral rites purify soul and
body, and the pilgrims return shriven and glad. But of all
the pilgrimages in India the most touching, the most marvellous,
is that to Amarnath, nearly twelve thousand feet up
in the Himalayas. The cruel difficulties to be surmounted,
the august heights to be climbed (for a part of the way is
much higher than the height at which the Cave stands), the
wild and terrible beauty of the journey, and the glorious
close when the Cave is reached, make this pilgrimage the
experience of a lifetime even for a European. What must it
not be for a true believer? Yet, in the deepest sense, I
should advise none to make it who is not a true believer—who
cannot sympathize to the uttermost with the wave of
faith and devotion that sends these poor pilgrims climbing
on torn and wearied feet to the great Himalayan heights,
where they not infrequently lay down their lives before
reaching the silver pinnacles that hold their hearts’ desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have myself made the pilgrimage, and it was one of the
deepest experiences of my life; while, as for the beauty and
wonder of the journey, all words break down under the effort
to express them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But first for a few words about the God who is the object of
devotion. The Cave is sacred to Siva—the Third Person of
the Hindu Trinity; that Destroyer who, in his other aspects,
is the Creator and Preserver. He is the God especially of
the Himalayas—the Blue-Throated God, from the blue
mists of the mountains that veil him. The Crescent in his
hair is the young moon, resting on the peak that is neighbour
to the stars. The Ganges wanders in the matted forests of
his hair before the maddening torrents fling their riches to
the Indian plains, even as the snow-rivers wander in the
mountain pine forests. He is also Nataraja—Lord of the
Cosmic Dance; and one of the strangest and deepest-wrought
parables in the world is that famous image where, in a wild
ecstasy, arms flung out, head flung back in a passion of motion,
he dances the Tandavan, the whole wild joy of the
figure signifying the cosmic activities of Creation, Maintenance
and Destruction. “For,” says a Tamil text, “our
Lord is a Dancer, who like the heat latent in firewood, diffuses
his power in mind and matter, and makes them dance
in their turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strange affinity of this conception with the discoveries
of science relating to the eternal dance of the atom
and electron gives it the deepest interest. I would choose
this aspect of the God as that which should fill the mind of
the Amarnath pilgrim. Let him see the Great God Mahadeo
(Magnus Deus), with the drum in one hand which symbolizes
creative sound—the world built, as it were, to rhythm
and music. Another hand is upraised bidding the worshipper,
“Fear not!” A third hand points to his foot, the
refuge where the soul may cling. The right foot rests lightly
on a demon—to his strength, what is it? A nothing, the
mere illusion of reality! In his hair, crowned with the
crescent moon, sits the Ganges, a nymph entangled in its
forest. This is the aspect of Mahadeo which I carried in
my own mind as I made the pilgrimage, for thus is embodied
a very high mysticism, common to all the faiths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the deities of India Maheshwara is the most complex
and bewildering in his many aspects. He is the Great
Ascetic, but he is also Lord of the beautiful daughter of the
Himalaya,—Uma, Parwati, Gauri, Girija, the Snowy One,
the Inaccessible, the Virgin, the Mystic Mother of India, to
give but a few of her many and lovely names. She too has
her differing aspects. As Kali, she is the goddess of death
and destruction; as Parwati, the very incarnation of the
charm and sweetness of the Eternal Femine. As Uma she
is especially Himalayan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the freezing mountain lake of Manasarovar she did
age-long penance for her attempt to win the heart of the
Great Ascetic, the Supreme Yogi,—her lovely body floating
like a lily upon its icy deeps, and so, at long last, winning
him for ever. She is the seeker of mountains, the Dweller
in the Windhya Hills, the complement of her terrible Lord
and Lover, whose throne is Mount Kailasa. Yet in some
of his moods she must be completely absorbed and subjugated
to ensure his companionship, for he is the archetype
of the perfected human yogi of whom says the ancient Song
Celestial that “he abides alone in a secret place without desire
and without possessions, upon a firm seat, with the
working of the mind and senses held in check, with body,
head and neck in perfect equipoise, meditating in order
that he may reach the boundless Abyss; he who knows the
infinite joy that lies beyond the senses and so becomes like
an unflickering lamp in a lonely place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This union is possible to Parwati and her Lord. So dear
are they each to the other that they are often represented as
a single image of which one half is male, the other female,
the dual nature in perfect harmony in the Divine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus then is the Great God to be visited in the high-uplifted
secret shrine of the mountains, which are themselves
the Lotus flower of creation. At dawn, suffused through all
their snows with glowing rose they dominate Indian thought
as the crimson lotus of Brahma the Creator. At noon, blue
in the radiant unveiled blue of the sky they are the blue
Lotus of Vishnu the Preserver, the Pillar of Cosmic Law.
At night, when all the earth is rapt in <span class='it'>samadhi</span>, the mystic
ecstasy, they are the snowy Lotus, throne of Siva, Maheshwara
the Great God, the Supreme Yogi when he dreams
worlds beneath the dreaming moon upon his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And India is herself a petal of the World Lotus of Asia as
the Asiatic mind conceives it. Look at Asia of the maps
and reverence the Flower which thrones all the Gods of
Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cave at Amarnath is sacred because a spring, eternally
frozen, has in its rush taken the shape of the holy
Lingam, which is the symbol of reproduction and therefore
of Life. This is also the Pillar of the Universe—that Pillar
which the Gods sought to measure, the one flying upward,
the other downward, for aeons, seeking the beginning and
the end, and finding none. Yet again, it is the Tree of Life,
which has its roots in Eternity, and branches through the
mythology of many peoples. And if there are degenerated
forms of this worship, surely the same may be said of many
others. And it is needful to know these things in order to
realize the significance of the worship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pilgrimage can be made only in July and August.
Before and after, a barrier of snow and ice closes the way,
and makes the Cave a desolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The start is made from Pahlgam, a tiny village on the
banks of the Lidar River in Kashmir, where it leaps from
the great glacier of Kolahoi to join the Jhelum River in the
Happy Valley. Pahlgam itself stands at a height of about
eight thousand feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before we started there was a great thunderstorm,
the grandest I have ever known. The mountains
were so close on each side that they tossed the thunder backwards
and forwards to each other, and the shattering and
roaring of the echoes was like the battles of the Gods or
the rolling of Maheshwara’s mighty drum in the mountain
hollows, while the continuous blue glare of the lightning
was almost appalling. It was strange to feel only a little
web of canvas between ourselves and that elemental strife
when the rain followed as if the fountains of the great deep
were broken up—cold as snow, stinging like hail, and so
steady that it looked like crystal harpstrings as it fell. Yet
next day we waked to a silver rain-washed world, sparkling
with prisms of rain and dew; fresh snow on the mountains,
and delicate webs of soft blue mist caught like smoke in the
pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we set forth from Pahlgam, with our cavalcade of
rough hill ponies carrying the tents and provisions and all
our substance, and began our march by climbing up the
river that flows from those eternal heights into the Pahlgam
valley. Much of the way can be ridden if one rides very
slowly and carefully for these wonderful animals are sure-footed
as cats; but the track is often terrifying—broken
boulders and the like. If the ponies were not marvels, it
could not be done; and if one were not a safe rider, one certainly
could not stick on. The pony gives a strong hoist
of his fore-legs, and you are up one rock and hanging on by
his withers; then a strong hoist of the hind legs and you are
nearly over his neck; and this goes on for hours; and when
it is beyond the pony you climb on your feet, and ford the
torrents as best you may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up and up the steep banks of the river we climbed, among
the pines and mighty tumbled boulders. Up by the cliffs,
where the path hangs and trembles over the water roaring
beneath. On the opposite side the mountains soared above
the birches and pines, and the torrents hung down them like
mist, falling, falling from crag to crag, and shattering like
spray-dust as they fell. Once a mighty eagle soared above
us, balancing on the wind, and then floated away without a
single motion of his wings—wonderful to see; and the spread
of his wings was greater than the height of the tallest man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had long passed the last few huts, and the track
wound steadily higher, when suddenly growing on us, I
heard a deep musical roar like the underlying bass of an
orchestra—the full-chorded voice of many waters. And
as we turned a corner where the trail hung like a line round
the cliff, behold, a mighty gorge of pines and uplifted hills,
and the river pouring down in a tremendous waterfall, boiling
and foaming white as it fell into the raging pit beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a sight! We stopped and looked, every sense
steeped in the wonder of it. For the air was cool with the
coolness that comes like breath off a river; our ears were
full of the soft thunder; the smell of pines was like the taste
of a young world in one’s mouth; yet it was all phantasmal,
in a way, as if it could not be real. I watched the lovely
phantom, for it hung like a thing unreal between heaven and
earth, until it grew dreamlike to me and dyed my brain with
sound and colour, and it was hard indeed to pass on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night we camped in a mountain valley some two
thousand feet above Pahlgam. It was like climbing from
story to story in a House of Wonder. The river was rushing
by our tents when they were pitched, pale green and
curling back upon itself, as if it were loath to leave these
pure heights, and the mountains stood about us like a prison,
almost as if we might go no farther. And when I stood
outside my tent just before turning in, a tremulous star was
poised on one of the peaks, like the topmost light on a Christmas
tree, and the Great Bear which in India is the constellation
of the Seven Rishis, or Sages, lay across the sky glittering
frostily in the blue-blackness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had a narrow escape that day; for, as I was leading the
cavalcade, I met a wild hill-rider in the trail between two
great rocks, and his unbroken pony kicked out at me savagely
with his foreleg and caught me above the ankle. Luckily,
they do not shoe their horses here; but it was pretty
bad for a bit, and I was glad of the night’s rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day we started and rounded out of the tiny valley;
and lo! on the other side another river, flowing apparently
out of a great arch in the mountainside. Out it poured, rejoicing
to be free; and when I looked, it was flowing, not
from the mountain but from a snow-bridge. Mighty falls
of snow had piled up at the foot of the mountain, as they
slipped from its steeps; and then the snow, melting above,
had come down as a torrent and eaten its way through the
wide arch of this cave. Often one must cross a river on
these snow-bridges, and at a certain stage of melting they
are most dangerous; for, if the snow should give, there may
be frightful depths beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here first I noticed how beautiful were the flowers of the
heights. The men gathered and brought me tremulous white
and blue columbines, and wild wallflowers, orange-coloured
and so deeply scented that I could close my eyes and call
up a cottage garden, and the beehives standing in sedate
rows under the thatched eaves. And there was a glorious
thistle, new to me, as tall as a man, well armed and girded
with blue and silver spears and a head of spiky rays.
Bushes, also, like great laurels, but loaded with rosy berries
that the Kashmiris love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turned then round a huge fallen rock, green and moist
with hanging ferns, and shining with the spray of the river,
and before us was a mountain, and an incredible little trail
winding up it, and that was our way. I looked and doubted.
It is called the Pisu, or Flea Ascent, on the dubious ground
that it takes a flea’s activity to negotiate it. Of course, it
was beyond the ponies, except here and there, on what I
called breathers, and so we dismounted. The men advised
us to clutch the ponies’ tails, and but for that help it would
have been difficult to manage. My heart was pumping in
my throat, and I could feel the little pulses beating in my
eyes, before I had gone far, and every few minutes we had
to stop; for even the guides were speechless from the climb,
and I could see the ponies’ hearts beating hard and fast under
the smooth coats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still we held on, and now beside us were blooming the
flower-gardens of the brief and brilliant Himalayan summer—beds
of delicate purple anemones, gorgeous golden ranunculus
holding its golden shields to the sun, orange poppies,
masses of forget-me-nots of a deep, glowing blue—a <span class='it'>burning</span>
blue, not like the fair azure of the Western flower, but
like the royal blue of the Virgin’s robe in a Flemish missal.
And above these swayed the bells of the columbines on their
slender stems, ranging from purest white, through a faint,
misty blue, to a deep, glooming purple. We could hardly
go on for joy of the flowers. It was a marvel to see all these
lovely things growing wild and uncared for, flinging their
sweetness on the pure air, and clothing the ways with beauty.
And at each turn fresh snow-peaks emerged against the infinite
blue of the sky—some with frail wisps of white cloud
caught in the spires, and some bold and clear as giants
ranged for battle—the lotus petals of the Infinite Flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so we climbed up and reached another story, and
lay down to rest and breathe before we went farther up into
wonderland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The top was a grassy “marg,” or meadow, cloven down to
the heart of the earth by a fierce river. Around it was a
vast amphitheatre of wild crags and peaks; and beneath
these, but ever upward, lay our trail. But the meadow
was like the field in Sicily where Persephone was gathering
flowers when she was snatched away by Dis to reign in the
Underworld. I remembered Leighton’s picture of her, floating
up from the dead dark, like a withered flower, and
stretching her hands to the blossoms of the earth once more.
I never saw such flowers; they could scarcely be seen elsewhere.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And here the myriad blossoms lay</p>
<p class='line0'>In shattered rainbows on the grass.</p>
<p class='line0'>Exulting in their little day</p>
<p class='line0'>They laughed aloud to see us pass.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We left them in their merriment,—</p>
<p class='line0'>The singing angels of the snows,—</p>
<p class='line0'>And still we climbed the steep ascent</p>
<p class='line0'>Along the sunward way it knows.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The snow had slipped off the meadow,—was rushing away
in the thundering river far below,—and the flowers were
crowding each other, rejoicing in the brief gladness of summer
before they should be shrouded again under the chilly
whiteness. But their colour took revenge on it now. They
glowed, they sang and shouted for joy—such was the vibration
of their radiance! I have never dreamed of such a
thing before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then came our next bad climb, up the bed of a ragged
mountain torrent and across it, with the water lashing at us
like a whip. I do not know how the ponies did it. They
were clutched and dragged by the ears and tails, and a man
seized me by the arms and hauled me up and round the
face of a precipice, where to miss one step on the loose stones
would have been to plunge into depths I preferred not to
look at. Then another ascent like the Flea, but shorter,
and we were a story higher, in another wild marg, all frosted
silver with edelweiss, and glorious with the flowers of another
zone—flowers that cling to the bare and lichened rock
and ask no foothold of earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a wild way. We climbed and climbed steadfastly,
sometimes riding, sometimes walking, and round us
were rocks clothed with rose-red saxifrage, shaded into pink,
and myriads of snowy stars, each with a star of ruby in its
heart. Clouds still of the wonderful forget-me-not climbed
with us. Such rock gardens! No earthly hand could plant
those glowing masses and set them against the warm russets
and golds of the lower crags, lifted up into this mighty sky
world. The tenderness of the soft form and radiant colour
of these little flowers in the cruel grasp of the rocks, yet
softening them into grace with the short summer of their
lives, is exquisitely touching. It has the pathos of all fragility
and brief beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later we climbed a great horn of rock, and rounded a
slender trail, and before was another camping-place—the
Shisha-Nag Lake among the peaks. We saw its green river
first, bursting through a rocky gateway, and then, far below,
the lake itself,—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We passed the frozen sea of glass</p>
<p class='line0'>Where never human foot has trod,</p>
<p class='line0'>Green as a clouded chrysoprase</p>
<p class='line0'>And lonely as a dream of God.—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>reflecting the snowy pinnacles above. The splintered peaks
stand about it. Until July it is polished ice, and out of one
side opens a solemn ante-chapel blocked with snow. The
lake itself is swept clear and empty. The moon climbs
the peaks and looks down, and the constellations swing
above it. A terrible, lonely place, peopled only by shadows.
It was awful to think of the pomps of sunrise, noon, and
sunset passing overhead, and leaving it to the night and
dream which are its only true companions. It should never
be day there—always black, immovable Night, crouching
among the snows and staring down with all her starlight eyes
into that polished icy mirror.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For days we went. We left their mirth</p>
<p class='line0'>For where the springs of light arise,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dawns lean over to the earth,</p>
<p class='line0'>And stars are split to lower skies</p>
<p class='line0'>White, white the wastes around us lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>The wild peaks gathered round to see</p>
<p class='line0'>Our fires affront the awful day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Our speech the torrents’ giant glee.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>We camped above the lake, and it was cold—cold! A
bitter wind blew through the rocks—a wind shrilling in a
waste land. Now and then it shifted a little and brought
the hoarse roar of some distant torrent or the crash of an
avalanche. And then, for the first time I heard the cry of
the marmot—a piercing note which intensifies the desolation.
We saw them too, sitting by their burrows; and then
they shrieked and dived and were gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We made a little stir of life for a while—the men pitching
our tents and running here and there to gather stunted
juniper bushes for fuel, and get water from an icy stream
that rippled by. But I knew we were only interlopers.
We would be gone next day, and chilly silence would settle
down on our blackened camp-fires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the piercing cold that cut like a knife I went out at
night, to see the lake, a solemn stillness under the moon. I
cannot express the awe of the solitudes. As long as I could
bear the cold, I intruded my small humanity; and then one
could but huddle into the camp-bed and try to shut out the
immensities, and sleep our little human sleep, with the camp-fires
flickering through the curtains, and the freezing stars
above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day we had to climb a very great story higher. Up
and up the track went steadily, with a sheer fall at one side
and a towering wall on the other. We forded a river where
my feet swung into it as the pony, held by two men, plunged
through. It is giddy, dazzling work to ford these swift
rivers. You seem to be stationary; only the glitter of the
river sweeps by, and the great stones trip the pony. You
think you are done, and then somehow and suddenly you are
at the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here a strange thing happened. When the morning
came, we found that a <span class='it'>sadhu</span>—a wandering pilgrim—had
reached the same height on his way to the Cave. He was
resting by the way, very wearied, and shuddering with the
cold. So I ventured to speak to him and welcome him to
our fire and to such food (rice) as he could accept from
some of our men; and there, when we stopped for the mid-day
meal, he sat among us like a strange bird dropped from
alien skies. Sometimes these men are repulsive enough, but
this one—I could have thought it was Kabir himself!
Scrupulously clean, though poor as human being could be,
he would have come up from the burning plains with his
poor breast bare to the scarring wind, but that some charitable
native had given him a little cotton coat. A turban,
a loin-cloth looped between the legs, leaving them naked,
grass sandals on feet coarse with travelling, and a string of
roughly carved wooden beads such as the Great Ascetic himself
wears in his images were all his possessions, except the
little wallet that carried his food—rice and a kind of lentil.
I thought of Epictetus, the saint of ancient Rome, and his
one tattered cloak.</p>

          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A wandering sadhu; far he came,</p>
<p class='line0'>His thin feet worn by endless roads;</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet in his eyes there burnt the flame</p>
<p class='line0'>That light the altars of the Gods.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The keen wind scarred his naked breast.</p>
<p class='line0'>I questioned him, and all the while</p>
<p class='line0'>The quiet of a heart at rest</p>
<p class='line0'>Shone in his secret patient smile.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yes, he had come from hot Bengal,</p>
<p class='line0'>From scorching plains to peaks of ice;</p>
<p class='line0'>Took what was given as chance might fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>And begged his little dole of rice.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“And have you friends, or any child?</p>
<p class='line0'>Or any home?” He shook his head,</p>

<p class='line0'>And “Empty,” was the word he said.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And so he sat beside our fire,</p>
<p class='line0'>As strange birds drop from alien skies,</p>
<p class='line0'>Gentle but distant, never nigher,</p>
<p class='line0'>With that remoteness in his eyes.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This was a man of about fifty-five, tall, thin, with a sensitive
face, yet with something soldierly about him; dignified
and quiet, with fine hawk-like features and strained bright
eyes in hollow caves behind the gaunt cheek-bones. A beautiful
face in both line and expression; a true mystic, if ever
I saw one!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told me he had walked from Bengal (look at the map
and see what that means!) and that the poor people were
very kind and gave him a little rice sometimes, when they
had it, and sometimes a tiny coin, asking only his prayers in
return. That he needed very little, never touching meat or
fish or eggs, which he did not think could be pleasing to God.
For sixteen years he had been thus passing from one sacred
place to the other—from the holy Benares to Hardwar where
the Ganges leaves the hills, and farther still, praying—praying
to the One. “There is One God,” he said; and again I
thought of Kabir, the supreme mystic, the incarnate Joy, who
also wandered through India,—striving, like this man:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He has looked upon God, and his eyeballs are clear;</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To learn and discern of his brother the clod,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And his brother the beast, and his brother the God.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>But does it not fill one with thoughts? That man had a
soul at rest and a clear purpose. And the Christ and the
Buddha were sadhus; and if it seem waste to spend the sunset
of a life in prayer, that may be the grossest of errors.
We do not know the rules of the Great Game. How should
we judge? So he came with us, striding behind the ponies
with his long steadfast stride, and his company was pleasing
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a wondrous climb. Had any God ever such an
approach to his sanctuary as this Great God of the heights?
We climbed through a huge amphitheatre of snows, above
us the ribbed and crocketed crags of a mighty mountain.
It was wild architecture—fearful buttresses, springing
arches, and terrible foundations rooted in the earth’s heart;
and, above, a high clerestory, where the Dawn might walk
and look down through the hollow eyeholes of the windows
into the deeps of the precipice below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suppose the architect was the soft persistence of water,
for I could see deep beach-marks on the giant walls. But
there it stood, crowned with snow, and we toiled up it, and
landed on the next story, the very water-shed of these high
places—a point much higher than the goal of our journey.
And that was very marvellous, for we were now in the bare
upper world, with only the sky above us, blue and burning
on the snow, the very backbone of the range; and, like the
Great Divide, the rivers were flowing both ways, according
to the inclination of the source.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before us lay snow which must be crossed, and endless
streams and rivers half or wholly buried in snow. That
was a difficult time. The ponies were slipping, sliding,
stumbling, yet brave, capable, wary as could be. I shall
for ever respect these mountain ponies. They are sure-footed
as goats and brave as lions and nothing else would
serve in these high places. In Tibet they have been known
to climb to the height of 20,000 feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes the snow was rotten, and we sank in; sometimes
it was firm, and then we slipped along; sometimes riding
was impossible, and then we picked our way with alpenstocks.
But everywhere in the Pass summer had its brief
victory, and the rivers were set free to feed the sultry Indian
plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we won through to another high marg, a pocket of
grass and blossom in the crags; and there, at Panjitarni, we
camped. Of course, we had long been above all trees, but
nothing seemed to daunt the flowers. This marg lay basking
in the sun, without one fragment of shade except when
the sun fell behind the peaks in the evening. But the flowers
quivered, glowed, expanded. My feet were set on edelweiss,
and the buttercups were pure gold. The stream ran
before me pure as at the day-dawn of the world, and from all
this innocent beauty I looked up to the untrodden snow, so
near, yet where only the eagle’s wings could take her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day was an enforced rest, for everyone, man and
beast, was weary; so we basked in the sun, reading and
writing, and but for the July snow and the awful peaks, it
was hard to believe that one was in the upper chambers of
the King’s Palace. Yet the air was strange, the water was
strange, and it was like a wild fairy-tale to look down from
my camp-bed and see the grey edelweiss growing thick beside
it, and hear the shriek of the marmot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day we should reach the Cave, and when it came the
morning looked down upon us sweet and still—a perfect
dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First we crossed the marg, shining with buttercups, and
climbed a little way up a hill under the snows, and then
dropped down to the river-bed under caves of snow for the
path above was blocked. It was strange to wade along
through the swift, icy waters, with the snow-caves arching
above us in the glowing sunlight. The light in these caves
is a wonderful lambent green, for the reflected water is
malachite green itself; but I was glad when the passage was
over, for it looked as if some impending mass must fall and
crush us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We climbed painfully out of the water, and in front was
a track winding straight up the mountain. It was clear that
we could not ride up; but we could not delay, so we started
as steadily as the ponies. I hardly know how they did it—the
men dragged and encouraged them somehow. And still
less do I know how we did it. The strain was great. At
one point I felt as if my muscles would crack and my heart
burst. We did the worst in tiny stages, resting every few
minutes, and always before us was the sadhu winning steadily
up the height. It was a weary, long climb, new elevations
revealing themselves at every turn of the track. Finally,
I fell on the top and lay for a bit to get my wind,
speechless but triumphant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rode then along the face of the hill—an awful depth
below, and beside us flowers even exceeding those we had
seen. Purple asters, great pearl-white Christmas roses
weighting their stems, orange-red ranunculus. It was a
broken rainbow scattered on the grass. And above this
heaven of colour was the Amarnath mountain at last—the
goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a descent when I hardly dared to look below
me. That too could not be ridden. In parts the track had
slipped away, and it was only about six inches wide. In others
we had to climb over the gaps where it had slipped. At
the foot we reached a mighty mountain ravine—a great cleft
hewn in the mountain, filled like a bowl to a fourth of its
huge depth with snow, and with streams and river rushing
beneath. We could hear them roaring hollowly, and see
them now and then in bare places. And at the end of the
ravine, perhaps two miles off, a great cliff blocked the way,
and in it was a black hole—and this was the Shrine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snow was so hard that we could ride much of the
way, but with infinite difficulty, climbing and slipping where
the water beneath had rotted the snow. In fact, this glen is
one vast snow-bridge, so undermined is it by torrents. The
narrowness of it and the towering mountains on each side
make it a tremendous approach to the Shrine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A snow-bridge broke suddenly under my pony and I
thought I was gone; but a man caught me by the arm, and
the pony made a wild effort and struggled to the rocks.
And so we went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cave is high up the cliff, and I could see the sadhu’s
figure striding swiftly on as if nothing could hold him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dismounted before the Cave, and began the last climb
to the mouth. I got there first, almost done, and lo! a
great arch like that of the choir of a cathedral; and inside, a
cave eaten by water into the rock, lighted by the vast arch,
and shallow in comparison with its height of 150 feet. At
the back, frozen springs issuing from the mountain. One
of the springs, the culminating point of adoration, is the
Lingam as it is seen in the temples of India—a very singular
natural frost sculpture. Degraded in the associations
of modern ignorance the mystic and educated behold in this
small phallic pillar of purest ice the symbol of the Pillar of
Cosmic Ascent, rooted in rapture of creation, rising to the
rapture of the Immeasurable. It represents That within the
circumference of which the universe swings to its eternal
rhythm—That which, in the words of Dante, moves the sun
and other stars. It is the stranger here because before it the
clear ice has frozen into a flat, shallow altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sadhu knelt before it, tranced in prayer. He had
laid some flowers on the altar, and, head thrown back and
eyes closed, was far away—in what strange heaven, who
shall say? Unconscious of place or person, of himself, of
everything but the Deity, he knelt, the perfect symbol of
the perfect place. I could see his lips move— Was it the
song of Kabir to the Eternal Dancer?—</p>

<p class='line0'>He is pure and eternal,</p>
<p class='line0'>His form is infinite and fathomless.</p>

<p class='noindent'>What better praise for such a worshipper before him in

<p class='line0'>Remote in skies we cannot win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laid my flowers on the altar of ice beside his. Who
could fail to be moved where such adoration is given after
such a pilgrimage? And if some call the Many-Named
“God,” and some “Siva,” what matter? To all it is the Immanent
God. And when I thought of the long winter and
the snow falling, falling, in the secret places of the mountains,
and shrouding this temple in white, the majesty of
the solitudes and of the Divine filled me with awe.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Outside the marmot’s cry was shrill,</p>
<p class='line0'>The mountain torrents plunged in smoke;</p>
<p class='line0'>Inside our hearts were breathless still</p>
<p class='line0'>To hear the secret word He spoke.</p>
<p class='line0'>We heard Him, but the eyelids close,</p>
<p class='line0'>The seal of silence dumbs the lips</p>
<p class='line0'>Of such as in the awful snows</p>
<p class='line0'>Receive the dread Apocalypse.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Later we climbed down into the snowy glen beneath the
Cave, and ate our meal under a rock, with the marmots
shrilling about us, and I found at my feet—what? A tuft
of bright golden violets—all the delicate penciling in the
heart, but shining gold. I remembered Ulysses in the Garden
of Circe, where the <span class='it'>moly</span> is enshrined in the long thundering
roll of Homer’s verse:—</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“For in another land it beareth a golden flower, but not in this.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>It is a shock of joy and surprise to find so lovely a marvel in
the awful heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were too weary to talk. We watched the marmots,
red-brown like chestnuts, on the rocks outside their holes,
till everything became indistinct and we fell asleep from utter
fatigue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way back was as toilsome, only with ascents and
descents reversed; and so we returned to Panjitarni.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day we rested; for not only was it necessary from
fatigue, but some of our men were mountain-sick because of
the height. This most trying ailment affects sleep and appetite,
and makes the least exertion a painful effort. Some
felt it less, some more, and it was startling to see our strong
young men panting as their hearts laboured almost to bursting.
The native cure is to chew a clove of garlic; whether it
is a faith cure or no I cannot tell, but it succeeded. I myself
was never affected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the journey down I will say little. Our sadhu journeyed
with us and was as kind and helpful on the way as
man could be. He stayed at our camp for two days when
we reached Pahlgam; for he was all but worn out, and we
begged him to rest. It touched me to see the weary body
and indomitable soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the time came for parting. He stood under a pine,
with his small bundle under his arm, his stick in his hand,
and his thin feet shod for the road in grass sandals. His
face was serenely calm and beautiful. I said I hoped God
would be good to him in all his wanderings; and he replied
that he hoped this too, and he would never forget to speak
to Him of us and to ask that we might find the Straight
Way home. For himself, he would wander until he died—probably
in some village where his name would be unknown
but where they would be good to him for the sake of the
God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he salaamed and went, and we saw him no more. Was
it not the mighty Akbar who said, “I never saw any man lost
in a straight road”?</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He came with us; we journeyed down</p>
<p class='line0'>To lowlier levels where the fields</p>
<p class='line0'>Are golden with the wheat new-mown,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all the earth her increase yields.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He told us that his way lay on.</p>
<p class='line0'>He might not rest; the High God’s cry</p>
<p class='line0'>Rang “Onward!” and the beacon shone,</p>
<p class='line0'>“And I must wander till I die.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“But when I speak unto my God</p>
<p class='line0'>I still will tell him you were kind,</p>

<p class='line0'>Until the Straight Way home you find.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He joined his hands in deep salute,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, smiling, went his lonely way,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sole, yet companioned, glad, yet mute,</p>
<p class='line0'>And steadfast toward the perfect day.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And still I see him lessening</p>
<p class='line0'>Adown the endless Indian plain.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet certain am I of this thing—</p>
<p class='line0'>Our souls have met—shall meet again.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Thus I have tried to give some dim picture of the wonders
of that wonderful pilgrimage. But who can express the
faith, the devotion that send the poorer pilgrims to those
heights? They do it as the sadhu did it. Silence and deep
thought are surely the only fitting comments on such a sight.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>THE MAN WITHOUT A SWORD</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(What is told in this story of jujutsu or judo, the Japanese national
science of self-defence and attack, is from the point of view of an
expert, strange as it may appear.)</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the true story of an experience which befell me
in Japan. For six years I have kept silence and I tell it
now only because my own knowledge assures me of the
growing interest in matters relating to what Oriental scholars
call “the formless world”—that is to say the sphere surrounding
us which we now know to be independent of solidity
and time as we conceive them, a world not to be grasped
by our fallible senses yet apprehended by some of us in certain
conditions not tracked and charted definitely. Modern
science, feeling after the mysterious, has named this world
which permeates ours and yet is invisible, the Fourth Dimension
because it is not subject to the three illusions of
length, breadth and height which imprison most of us from
the cradle to the grave. But why philosophize? Let me
tell my story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My name is Hay, and I am a middle-class Scotchman, a
public school and University man who, like others, took
part in the War. I came through whole and sound but it
left its mark. For one thing, it knocked to smithereens the
average ideals of success and attainment, which, again like
others, had shaped my life, and from being a strictly average
man in that I followed the herd in all its decencies of convention
the war left me naked and unsheltered in the open
without a rag of conviction to hide me from the truth if it
should happen to pass my way. But I had ceased to believe
in its existence outside the things we use in daily intercourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another effect also. My war experience was naval and
chiefly in the Mediterranean where men of all nationalities
were coming and going, and that constant contact wore thin
the shell an Englishman inhabits—such crustaceans as we
are!—until I began to see in what different terms the universe
may be stated from the differing angles of race and
nationality. What helped me to this understanding was a
friendship I struck up with a Japanese naval officer—a remarkable
fellow as I thought then and know now. He
spoke English perfectly and had not only read but inwardly
digested what he read, which is more than can be said for
most of us. I owed him two services besides. He taught
me to speak Japanese—I am quick at languages,—and being
a great expert in the national art of defence and attack
which is known as jujutsu, he began to give me lessons which
were the beginning of much. His name was Arima, his
age the same as mine—thirty-four,—and for very different
reasons we both left our services when the war shut down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet I knew our friendship would not end there, nor did
it. One day while I was dining alone in my club in London,
wondering whether I should ever again find anything which
I honestly felt worth doing, a letter reached me. I knew
the almost mercantile precision of the hand before I opened
it and it sent a pleasurable thrill through nerves which had
been stagnant with exhaustion since I had been ashore.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hay sama,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think much of you and wonder if you ever free a thought
to cross the sea to my little house in Kyushu. That is our southern
island and since illness drove me from our navy I live there. I
need the sunshine of a friend’s company and if you feel the same
need come, I beg you, and make me a long visit. I live in a
beautiful valley run through by a river which will please you. It
flows by rocks and mountains, pine woods and prosperous villages;
a happy land. Not far from my house is a temple to
Hachiman, God of War. I do not pay my devotions there for
reasons which you will understand. But come, my friend. I
have learned many things since we met and no doubt it is the same
with you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That letter flung up a window in a stifling room. It
meant escape from the dull indifference besetting me and
contact with those people who of all in the world preserve
the Stoic virtues which seemed to be the only ones likely
to extricate me from my Slough of Despond. I wrote my
answer within ten minutes and in two months I was in
Japan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not go at once to Arima, nor will I tell my first adventures
on landing and making myself at home in Tokyo.
They are neither good reading nor thinking. I had more
than one reason to regret that Arima had made me free of
the country by giving me its tongue. Pretty well worn out,
with a stale taste of sour regrets in my mouth, I went down
at last to Kyushu, and in the garden of Arima’s delightful
little house I take up the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a true Japanese garden, a wide landscape seen
through the diminishing end of a telescope. There was a
forest, a mountain which had spilt its mighty boulders by
the side of a running river with a Chinese bridge thrown
over it. True, one could have bestridden the mountain and
hopped the river, but what did that matter? The real river,
the Kogagawa, rippled beside the grass which ran down to
where a great willow dipped cool fingers in liquid crystal
from the mountain heights, and under that green veil of
drooping boughs with eyes half closed it was possible to
dream that the little garden passed into the idea which had
filled its maker’s mind, and became grand and terrible, a
place of wild beauty and awe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be so,” said Arima smiling, “because he saw it
so, and what a man has once clearly seen is registered immortal
and can be seen by others when necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat under the willow, his fine bronzed face and throat
bare to the flitting shadows of trembling leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who made it?” I asked. “He cannot have been a common
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was my great-great-grandfather and very far from
a common man. I have a paper in his own hand which tells
why and how he made it and it is a very strange story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw away his cigarette and sat looking at the wandering
paths paved with flat stones here and there, the little
flowering herbs springing in the crevices; at the mountain
where, altering the scale, you might wander and be lost for
dreadful days in mighty gorges and ravines. The river
swept round it in a rapid current possibly two feet wide and
joined the Kogagawa in a lovely bay quite four feet across
where a fairy fleet might have anchored after a prosperous
voyage from Stratford on Avon in the dream of a midsummer
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day I will read you his paper, but not yet. I have
reasons for delay. The spirit of our country is hovering
over you but has not yet entered in and possessed you.
People come to Japan in ship-loads and see the surface
bright with colour and gaiety which we spread out before
them. But they do not know. We do not mean they
should. To be truthful—I do not think any foreigner can
understand Japan unless he is a Buddhist at heart— As
you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” I echoed in uttermost astonishment. “My good
fellow, I am nothing. I haven’t the devil of a ghost of a
notion what it all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at me with a quaint smile hiding in the deeps
of his narrow eyes. It peered out like a wise gnome, as old
as the hills and older.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your downstairs self knows very well. It has not passed
it on yet to your honourable upstairs self. But the wireless
begins to talk and the air is full of voices beating at
your ears. What stories they will tell you! I should like
to hear them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment I could not be sure that he was in earnest.
But I could ask, for it was an intimate hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The full moon was rounding up from behind the mountain
of Naniwa where the monastery of the Thousand-Armed
Kwannon, Spirit of Pity, looks out over a wide and
wonderful landscape of woods and valleys. That day we
had visited the house of the Abbot,—The House Built upon
Clouds, they call it, and there, for a moment I had had an
experience new and very difficult to describe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet I must try. It began with a physical sensation like
a strange intake of breath which I could not expel, and made
my heart beat violently. That passed, but I thought it had
affected my head for it seemed that my memory was disturbed.
I could not remember my name, and my past life,
as I recalled it from childhood, was gone, shrunk to an
invisible point so small that I could look over it to something
beyond. That something moved in cloudy shapes impossible
to focus into clear vision. I saw as one sees when a
telescope needs adjusting and another turn will clear all
into intelligibility. But for a moment I had dropped my
historic, racial sense like a garment, and the monk with his
calm face like lined and weathered ivory seemed nearer to
me than anyone I had ever known though it was not half an
hour since we had met. I could remember his sonorous
Japanese name. My own was gone. I must place the scene
clearly. Arima was examining some ancient vessels of fine
three-metal work from Tibet, and the Abbot and I stood by
the window looking out over the vast drop of the valley
from such a height that it was like a swallow’s nest in the
eaves of the spiritual city. Suddenly I was aware that our
eyes were fixed on each other, on my side with passionate,
on his with searching intensity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, what shall I say? I was conscious that something
arresting had happened and could not tell myself what it
was. But it was his eyes through which I looked, as through
a window, with an overwhelming question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, he was speaking in a clear low monotone like running
water. It was as though he continued a conversation
of which I had lost the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can you expect to see without concord of mind?
Yours is in the confusion of a tossing sea. It has no direction.
The way you must follow is to repeat these words
until you understand them perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and enunciated these strange words clearly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no parents. I make the heavens and the earth
my parents. I have no magic. I make personality my
magic. I have no strength. I make submission my
strength. I have neither life nor death. I make the Self-Existent
my life and death. I have no friends. I make my
mind my friend. I have no armour. I make right-thinking
and right-doing my armour. Can you remember this? It
is the beginning.” Looking in his eyes I remembered and
repeated it perfectly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” he said with calm approval.—“And there is
one clause more. An important one. ‘I have no sword.
I make the sleep of the mind my sword.’ That signifies
that the outer reasoning self, which is really nothing, must
be lulled asleep and put off its guard before the inner self,
which is All, can function.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly as it had come the experience ended. I was
released. I stood in the window, watching the softly floating
clouds, the waving woods far, far beneath, the wheeling
of a drove of swallows in blue air. The Abbot was speaking
with Arima; they were handling the vessels, barbarically
rich, and discussing them with interest. Had my experience
been some wild momentary distortion of the brain? I
shuddered as if with cold. My hands were shaking. Then
all was normal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, clambering down the hundreds of beautiful broken
steps overgrown with flowers and moss where so many generations
have come and gone in pilgrimage, I said nothing
to Arima. It had become impossible. Something called
the war to my mind and I said something careless, but he
waved that aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must speak of it no more. Why steep one’s soul in
illusion? Much that we thought real and allowed to affect
us was nothing, and the emotions it caused less than nothing.
I have awaked. You are near the dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought this remark cruel, and said something heated
about the dead who had paid with their lives for the illusion—the
ignorant things one does say! He received it with
his invulnerable Japanese courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went too fast. Pardon me. The Buddha alone can
impart knowledge to the Buddha, and who am I that I should
speak? The time and the master come together. Here,
my friend,—you should drink of this running water. It
comes from a beautiful spring in the mountain above. They
call it ‘Light Eternal’ and say that to taste of it is to drink
perfect health. If only it were as easy as that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the mossy rock lay two little dippers of pure white
wood. I was extremely English at that instant and nothing
would have induced me to soil my lips with a cup used by
strangers. I hooped my hands and drank,—he, from the
dipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You miss the sacrament,” he said, “but the water in any
case is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so we went home, talking of the treasures of the
monastery, wonders of art, famous throughout Japan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, in the gathering night concentrating its radiance
in a moon so glorious as to obscure the nearer stars, in the
breathless silence made vocal by the ripple of the river on
its eternal way, beneath the dropped veil of the willow influences
were loosed which opened my heart, and I told
Arima my experience of the afternoon. I asked whether
he had been conscious of what had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was a shadow beneath the boughs. I saw only
the moonlight in his eyes as he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I knew nothing. The Abbot Gyōsen was speaking
with me all the time. I thought you were absorbed in
the view. It is most wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That could not satisfy me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible,” I said. “For how could that strange formula
come into my mind? I never heard it before. I
have not the faintest notion what it means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief silence, then he answered slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I scarcely think it my part to clear up the matter. Will
you not ask the Abbot himself? Yet there are one or two
things I could say if you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing I was in earnest he continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Abbot Gyōsen is a remarkable man. In the first
place seclusion in a mountain temple in devout contemplation
purifies the heart, and then he is a deep student of Zen.
Zen is the science of mental or spiritual concentration. In
India they call it Yoga. A man who possesses this knowledge
can do things which to the ignorant of its powers appear
miracles. They are perfectly natural however. In
his youth he had magnificent skill in jujutsu. No man could
stand up against him. There was a reason for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent for a moment, and then added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His influence is enormous. You would scarcely credit
the true stories I could tell of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I listened in deep reflection, staring at the broken ripples
of moonlight in the river. Again the weird intake of breath
seized me, my heart beat rapidly with the consciousness that
I was face to face with the Unknown; that it had eyes but
I was blind, groping in the dark. Light, light: That was
the cry within me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The formula?” I asked, when my breath steadied again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not see even his eyes now. Arima was an invisible
presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Japan,” he said, “in connection with jujutsu and otherwise
we recognize a strange force which we call <span class='it'>kiai</span>, a very
powerful dynamic. We consider it a manifestation of the
primal energy. It lies all round us for the taking by anyone
who will use the necessary means and in itself is neither
good nor evil. The result depends on the person who uses
it. What the Abbot Gyōsen passed into your mind was
certain of the first rules of this knowledge. We call them
the Rules of Detachment. He must have been conscious
that you have reached the fit stage for instruction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then all I can say is that he was entirely mistaken. He
could hardly choose a worse subject for any spiritual experiments
than myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arima laughed slightly but kindly as one laughs at a
child’s ignorant certitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not possible. Men of his sort are not mistaken.
But <span class='it'>you</span> mistake. Certainly this force may be employed
for a very high kind of spiritual adventure, but in itself it is
neutral. It is only a force, and what he foresees for you I
cannot tell. It is a sword. Now a sword may be employed
by a god or a devil or any of the grades between.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea was so new to me that I said nothing for a moment,
revolving the thing inwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you mean that a force of tremendous possibility
lies about us for anyone to use who will? That a man can
handle the powers of miracle——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no miracle. There is only Law and some of us
understand it better than others. Knowledge is always
power and the unscrupulous may know as well as the saints.
But they will know from a different and disastrous angle.
Does one always see power in worthy hands? You and I
who have lived through the war know better than that.
No, this force is applicable to small things as to great. It
can mean success in money-grubbing or the open door to
an apostleship. As I said—it is a sword. But it cannot be
trifled with. It carries you to a stage where you perceive
the danger too late and are seized with an indescribable
horror. The wings melt in the sun’s flame, and then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made an eloquent gesture with his hand which suggested
a fall from some unimagined height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t believe it,” I said resolutely. “That whatever
rules the universe should trust it anywhere to clumsy or
wicked interference— No, impossible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet we see it daily,” Arima replied calmly. “But
things always come right in the long run. This power of
which I speak is only one gesture of the Supreme and there
is much behind it. Illusions pass like clouds but the sun
remains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—but,” I hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is this which explains the mystery of good and evil,
as we call them. Think it out and you will see. Shall
we go in now? I have a fancy that the processes of the
night—even the river—like to be free of us intruders.
If we are not in harmony with them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arima!” I said on an impulse, “have you this secret?
I think—I know that in your hands it would be safe. What
you have said makes me long for more. If the Abbot
judged me fit for so much—and you say he must have
known——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stretched his hand in the moonlight and grasped mine
in a strong clasp. I had a sensation of something throbbing
and beating from his wrist to mine. It flowed tingling
along my veins until it was warm about my heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is day!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard no more. It was day. A fierce sun blazed upon
me and I was alone in an unknown country. A mountain,
in contour like the famous Fuji, loomed up majestic, snow
spilt down its sides like the sticks of a half opened fan.
I stood in a mighty gorge beside a fiercely running mountain
river, the swift torrent forced back by its own speed among
the rocks in curling white waves. Where two rocks craned
forward to each other from opposing shores a noble Chinese
bridge, huge stones gigantically moulded almost to a semi-circular
spring, spanned and bridled the wild creature beneath,
and on either shore was a willow tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why was it familiar though so strange? But I stood
bewildered. A moment ago I had been beside my friend
in moonlight and quiet, now a great sun beat on tossing
mountains and river, and I was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Terribly alone. I stood ignorant which way to turn,
helpless, baffled, in a place which might have been empty
from the world’s beginning, but for the bridge. Would
anyone ever come? Should I roam there imprisoned in
vastness until I died? It was a nightmare of terror. I
ran to the great willow as if for refuge in its tent of delicate
shifting shade, and pushing aside the boughs I entered and
sat down throwing my arm about the trunk, smooth, warm,
as the flesh of a woman, that I might steady myself against
something living and tangible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are Dryads in Japan, tree spirits, and especially
do they haunt the willow. Beautiful, alarming, some of the
stories, but always instinct with the life which lies just
below our horizon. Now I was conscious of some presence
beside me, not to be accosted until its own moment of
choice. I put out my hand instinctively; it met nothing.
I said a word aloud. No answer. And again most disabling
fear submerged me. Then, clear and small, as if written, the
Rules of Detachment rose in my mind, and hurrying, I repeated
them under my breath, not knowing how they could
help, but catching at anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no parents. I make the heavens and the earth
my parents. I have no strength. I make submission my
strength.” And so to the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no sword. I make the sleep of the mind my
sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as I said these words the meaning flashed upon me
in light. Here was I—alone in a frightful solitude—so
desolate that it might have been the Mountains of the
Moon. What means of escape could I make for myself?
What friends had I—what sword? The Rules assured me.
The enemies—the mountains, the wild ways, were my slaves
if I could believe it. In submission strength awaited me.
In the surrender of the plotting reason, which can only
break tangible material obstacles, my latent powers would
function. And what were they?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more and confidently I repeated the words, knowing
that they unloosed some hard-bound knot in my being. I
willed to be in the garden of Arima. My one instinct was
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sitting beneath the willow tree— Yes, but in
Arima’s garden, and he was beside me looking steadfastly at
the river where moonlight flowed away with it to the ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impossible to describe the shock of relief. It never
occurred to me to ask if I had been asleep—to think I had
been hypnotized or anything of the kind. I knew the experience
was real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have I been?” That was the only possible question.
He replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the garden. Did you not recognize it? See—the
mountain, the tumbled rocks, the river and bridge. <span class='it'>But</span>
in the garden as my ancestor first saw it. Some day you
shall hear why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But first—first— Was I long there? Time—I forgot
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are there now, only the blinkers are over your
eyes again. And as to time—there is no such thing as
time. There is only eternity. If I count in the way we
measure when we wear our blinkers you had the sight for
twenty-four hours. It was last night when it began. Now
it is to-night. I have slept, have eaten, have walked to the
village and written many letters and all the time you sat
here. Time is really nothing but a dream—a necessity
in the world of the Three Dimensions. As soon as you
break the shell—it is nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again I cannot describe the tumult of feeling in me,
mingled with a passionate longing for something of my own
lost and ravished from me. I had a sense of unutterable
weakness and shame. He read my thought like speech and
answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you threw it from yourself. You were frightened,
forlorn, and you caught at the Rules and concentrated, and
being power they acted as you wished, and transported
you back into the blindness of the daily life that walls us
in from the Lovely, the Utterly Desirable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean,” I said slowly, “that one can ruin oneself
as easily as save. And that I should not have come back at
my own will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. One must always go on. To come back is
highly dangerous. If you had had patience and had concentrated
upon what is called ‘extension’ you would have
climbed the mountain and on the other side——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? What?” I cried, for he paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We call it the Shining Country. You would have—liked
it! Also you would have met the One who Waits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I repeated in bewilderment;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The One who Waits? But who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell. Different people probably for everyone.
It might have been my great-great-grandfather for all I
know. He is often in his garden. But it is the right
one always. Don’t think I blame you though for using
your scrap of power in a fright. That often happens at
first. What man has mastered jujutsu at the first throw?
Still, he may be badly hurt, and you are hurt and will pay
for it. Later on, beware that you never use power to bring
you back to the place you have left it. A man pays for that
to the last farthing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean—snatching at the wrong things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in a way. The wrong things for you. There is
no fixed way or rigid moral standard. There cannot be.
All depends upon the man himself and the occasion, and—many
a man has been saved by his sins. One learns the
rules as one goes. Of course the rudiments of them govern
every sort of society of men civilized or uncivilized. But
you must be hungry. Come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall never forget that meal. Nothing could be simpler.
There were rice cakes, honey, eggs, and pale fragrant tea.
But—I despair of words—the food had new meanings. I
could feel the good of it, the life of nature, of living things,
passing into my blood, so restorative that when it was eaten
I felt like a tuned violin on the shoulder of a mighty master;
not a sound or sight but drew harmonious answer from
my spirit. The river flowed from the footstool of the
Eternal. Each flower shouted its evangel and their chorus
was that of the morning stars singing together. The dart
of the swallows was the flight of arrows from the bow of
Love. They dazzled in blue air. I daresay no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arima came out in his cotton kimono and bare head.
I saw new meanings in his face each moment, and the
bronzed beauty of the man struck on a naked nerve, as
though each sight of beauty awakened a longing for the
next step beyond. He read my thought, and pausing in
his work of training a fruit bough answered meditatively;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, even the first breath of air in that country is inspiration.
It is full of dangers—a fighting country, sometimes
a No Man’s Land. Some of its ways seem to lead
horribly downward. And there is always hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell? A state of mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and of body too—they sometimes involve each
other. But it braces one. There is much more to it than
you can know yet. Only remember—one has got to break
into that country somehow unless one is content to be the
prisoner of the senses for a whole wasted lifetime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shuddered slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the present moment I don’t feel that I ever want
to see it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Natural enough. Let us have a bout of jujutsu now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stripped, and he threw me as he always did, but all
the same I was learning. I got a new lock that day and,
more important, made an advance in pliability. I stooped
and yielded and released myself when I thought he had got
me for good. He shouted with pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right! You will be a shodan one day. That is our
lowest teaching grade. Now rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came up to me an hour later:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wishing to go to the Kwannon monastery to see
the Abbot. He will receive you. Before you start would
you like to hear the story of my ancestor and the garden?
It is very short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange. I had not thought of the Abbot, but I knew now
that to see him was my inmost wish. That had been the
meaning of my joy. I nodded, and Arima led the way to
the willow. I did not then know why but the magic of
the garden centred in that willow, thrilled in every leaf of
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sat down in its shade; I, on the grass with my arms
clasped about my knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My ancestor was a handsome young man, and the only
son of a rich and noble family who owned much land about
here. Nearly all ran through his fingers in his extravagance
and flowed away from the family like river-water, until
only a few acres just here were left. I need not tell you
all his life—you can imagine the story of a rich, reckless,
sensuous fellow without bit or bridle. But he was a fine
soldier, a fine poet—we think much of that in Japan—and
he wrote the story of his life later with such fire and drama
and such strange hidden things, that if it could be printed—but
it never could. People would not believe it. Some
day you shall read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange change came over the garden while he spoke.
It extended itself before my eyes—flowing outward softly.
The flowering bushes which had been within a few feet were
now vague in the distance. The mountain flung a cone
of shadow over leagues. Even as I saw this, we were in
the land of True Sight—yes, that was its name—and
Arima was telling his story under the willow of my terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had broken his own wife’s heart. He coveted the
love of the wife of a man of good birth—a samurai named
Satoro, and taking her by force made her his own. The
husband, unarmed, met him here in what is now this garden,
and when he drew his sword to attack him, by the power
of the most skilful jujutsu dashed the sword from his hand
and himself to the ground, breaking his jaw and blinding
him with blood. He had to endure the disgrace. Terrible
humiliation for a nobleman! No help— Look about you
and see how lonely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awful and vast the mountains stretched away into snowy
silences with the muted roar of a distant avalanche. Cold,
shudderingly cold the river, frozen in the pools with a bitter
glaze of ice. No life, no death, but arrested petrifaction,
with the moon stranded on a peak in a dead world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the sword! A sword worn by his ancestors in
knightly fashion, pure steel and gold—the very spirit of
the house. Satoro picked it up and stood leaning on it
over the prostrate man as he lay on the rocks writhing like
a crushed snake to hide his ruined face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘This place is your own heart,’ he said; ‘cold, empty
and dead. You will come back to it times out of mind.
Kimi san, my wife, is on the other side of the mountain.
You never possessed her; she is mine. But what I have
to say is this. Your sword also is mine. I have a lien on
you. You are my slave. I tell you now to begin at the
beginning. You shall learn jujutsu. What it will teach you
is to defend yourself from yourself. And when you have
learnt that— Then I shall give you fresh orders.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man raved and swore and spat blood, all unintelligibly
as a beast. He was humiliated in all that a Japanese
noble most values, and his only thought at the moment
was revenge and suicide. The other stood, looking down
upon him with calm. ‘I will return the sword to my lord
when he knows its use. A good sword scorns an ignorant
wearer. Now I leave you, but we shall meet in this place.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went off, walking lightly and strongly. The fallen
man dragged himself together. To lose his sword— Do
Westerners understand that bitterness? I cannot tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A retainer came by and finding him, summoned help.
When they got him to the house, they told him the woman
was dead. She had severed an artery in her throat as a
Japanese lady must do in the face of dishonour. Blind
with rage he sent to the house of her husband to slaughter
him. He had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Henceforth my ancestor was known as The Man without
a Sword—a terrible name. He could not appear among
the nobles. His life was a ruined thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arima paused again and then added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be better that the Abbot should tell you
the rest. You will think it remarkable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood up, so possessed with the story, for he had told
it like one inspired, that it was only as I moved that my
position flashed on me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I go? I am lost in the mountains. Come
with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood beside me, looking onward:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is impossible. There are never any guides.
There is only power. Besides, there are different ways for
different people and I know nothing of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked about me, considering. The bridge was the
obvious way and certainly the easiest. I did not know
the hour, and there was a hint of dusk in the air, but I
had already learnt that in this strange land time and its
phenomena have quite other meanings than with us. Night
might break on me in a wave of sunlight or dawn open
its rose in the heart of midnight. Who could tell? But
the bridge way would be safer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned to say a last word to Arima. There was no
human being in sight; it was a vast solitude dominated by
the black cone of the mountain’s shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made for the bridge walking as quickly as the rough
stones allowed, and climbing its semi-circular hump I looked
before me and rejoiced to see the track much clearer than
it had seemed from the other side. Evidently a well-used
way, and this encouraged me in my hope of meeting someone
who could direct me to the monastery of Naniwa.
Therefore I went with more confidence, relieved from the
crawling fear of the supernatural which the other side of
the bridge inspired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The track took me up a slight rise and round a jutting
rock which obscured the river, and having done about two
miles of quick walking I heard steps coming round a bend
of the trail and rejoiced to think I could ascertain the
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearer they came and disclosed a Japanese, his kimono
pulled up through the obi for the ease of walking. He
made the usual polite bow and would have passed but for
my raised hand. I asked my way with the honorifics I
had learnt from Arima. He stopped at once and replied
with the utmost courtesy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The monastery? Yes— You could go this way. One
reaches it by several. But it is not the right way. Far
from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then will you tell me how to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I cannot tell you. I wish I could. I really do not
know your way.” It was infuriating. I said scoffingly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you know this is wrong surely you know which is
right?” He replied as if he were saying the most ordinary
thing in the world:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, it is not so easy as you think. Places are states
of mind in this country, therefore you will honourably see
that no one can tell anyone else their way and how best to
get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bowing, he made to pass me. It was then that
for the first time I noticed two things. One that his
hair was dressed in the old-fashioned queue headdress which
one sees in Japanese prints, shaved, but for a knot drawn
up on the head, the other that he had a most remarkable
face. The features were good, even excellent, and the dark
bright colouring fine. But the eyes were arresting under
the black level brows, and filled with tranquillity as a pool
with shadows. On the impulse they gave me I spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, that could hardly be. I come from Yedo and I
go to my garden in the valley you have left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yedo!—the ancient and long-disused name of Tokyo,—and
Tokyo on the central island and days’ journey away!
Train and boat might have brought him, and yet—shivering
doubt assailed me like the thin creeping of drops of water
through a dyke which presages the later roar of the flood.
The garden! I could not withhold myself nor hesitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want to know my name you must watch what
road I take and know to what I return. How can you
know? I did not even think you would have seen me.
Since it is so however, I will repeat that in this road you
will have great need of self-defence. Now I bid you goodbye
and wish you safely at Naniwa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone round the corner so quickly that I had a sensation
of vanishing. I ran after him and looked. Nothing.
So I took my way onward. He had told me nothing to
change it. A word really would have sent me backward
to try my luck in another direction but he had not spoken it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after it was dark and raining, with a moon very
young and bewildered in drifting clouds. She gave a weary
light scarcely enough to hint the track and indicate a group
of trees, the first I had seen, on the right. Coming up,
among them was a small flickering light, and the barking
of a dog sounded homely and even inviting, for by this
time I was dragging tired feet. If I could sleep there how
welcome the rest and shelter!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place looked poor and dilapidated enough to be open
to any offer of payment though in any case I might have
trusted to the hospitality of the country Japanese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knocked at the rough door wondering that anyone could
exist in such a tumble-down place and a young girl came to
the door, faintly seen in dim lamplight. She stared at
me in astonishment and bowing low, called softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, mistress,—what shall I do? A gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young voice answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him to come in if he will do us such an honour,”
and a graceful little figure appeared in the opening of a
lattice door, her face unseen because the light fell behind
her. I obeyed. Poor as the house was that room was
enchanting. Very simple, but the draperies were good, the
cushions beautiful in colour, the <span class='it'>hibachi</span> was full of charcoal
and above and round all bathing it in charm was the
delicate perfume of a woman’s presence. She rose from her
profound Japanese salutation and looked me in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hay sama!” she faltered, paling to the lips. And I
knew—I knew!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months before in the crowded city of Tokyo I had
gone to a dinner at a restaurant near Shimbashi. I remembered
the garden outside with clumps of gorgeous chrysanthemums,
lamps of splendid colour before the dusk drowned
them and the moon washed them with silver. Geisha
attended us, girls with every nerve braced and strung for
their profession of charming the wary and unwary alike.
And I was charmed by the sad mirth that looked out from
one pair of dark and lovely eyes. I drew her aside before the
evening ended and asked her to follow me to the <span class='it'>machiai</span>—a
house of meeting, and escaping from the noisy party
I waited in the cold handsomely furnished room that never
spoke of love, until she came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That meeting led to many things—some merry, some
sad, but when I left Tokyo to see her no more I knew that
the part I had played was to set my heel on her little head
and drive her deeper into the mire. Still, it was ended
and need trouble me no more. One could forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I sat by her side in this land of bitter memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a cushion beside mine and leaning her little
black head against my shoulder looked up in my face,
welcoming me with the sweet courtesy mingled with fear
that I remembered so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why are you here in this wild place, Hana san?
Have you given up your work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her bewildered look! I can see it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell? I—I came. I was told it must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are resting here? You go back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us talk of other things, Hay sama. How I am
glad to see you!” I could get nothing more from her than
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence and the little noises of dropping charcoal, and
the softness of her in my arms. It was a renewal of that
passionate intimacy which had left a wound in the very
heart of my soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We talked into the small hours,—so much to say, so much
to hear, and time passed—hours, days— How could I tell?
And then as fatigue and quiet and warmth overpowered
all my resolution she put her arms about me and gathered
me to her bosom and the night melted into passion and
passion into dream and the dark stole past us on noiseless
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waked in a chill dawn alone, disillusioned and abashed,
dragged back violently to a thing I had forgotten and
abhorred. The room was empty, a cold wind blowing
through the tattered paper of the window, and when I called,
no answer. The two women had gone with the night. No
food, no fire, dead ash in the <span class='it'>hibachi</span>, emptiness and the
squalid decay of a wooden house long forgotten. What had
a beauty of Tokyo been doing in such a place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fear of the loneliness seized me. I went out quickly
without looking after me, then at the twist of the path
turned and saw—desolation and waving weeds and a bough
of some bush thrust through the window that had taken
root within. I pushed on toward Naniwa, sick at heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at that moment a thought shot through me and
chilled my blood. When Arima and I had visited Naniwa
it had taken us exactly two hours from his house to the
monastery hill. But yesterday I had walked for many
hours, and to-day seemed no nearer my goal. Grey interminable
moorland stretched before me with a mountain
blocking the way at a distance and other tossing peaks beyond.
Where was I? Where was Naniwa? Might I not
walk for ever and ever in widening circles to a lost goal?
The ground whispered with evil in every blade of grass.
It hissed in the rustle of dry squat bushes. And last night—last
night! There were reasons why that memory
brought horror and shame to be my companions on the
right and left. But I went on from sheer inability to consider
what else I must do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clump of bushes on the right parted and a tall strong
fellow burst out of them and planted himself across my
way. A Japanese, broad, brawny, violent-faced. As I
halted he sprang at my throat like a wolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you tracked her here? You could not let her be?
Then take your payment from her husband Kondo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened next came in a blinding flash. He struck
at me with a loaded stick. It missed the first blow and I
had him by the throat with the new lock I had learnt from
Arima, shaking him violently to and fro, driving my fingers
deeper and deeper into his flesh in a frenzy of rage and
hate. I would have the innermost heart’s blood of the
brute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had it. He reeled in my grasp with horrible choking
noises, and suddenly I was shaking the life out of a dead
thing. As I thrust him from me with sickening triumph
he fell heavily as a full sack prone on the track before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must have been long before the rage died in me and
I stood face to face with my position. I—a foreigner—had
killed a Japanese, and after an intrigue with his wife.
It felled me beside him—I crouched and hid my face and
tried to think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently I rose and with the murderer’s instinct dragged
the corpse into the bushes to hide it. Thought was impossible.
I suffered as a dumb beast must suffer the extremity
of torture without the power to reason. Only I
must hide it and flee. The neighbourhood of the horrible
thing was hell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later— “Is it just—is it just?” I said to myself, “that
one instant’s madness should doom a man for ever?”—forgetting
the long temptation I had played with, the slow
delicious yielding, the triumph and delight with which I had
slowly built up my torture chamber. Not only from the
time I landed in Japan, but before,—I had been busy at the
building all my life. How could I complain when the trap
snapped on me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last I broke from the numbness into memory. The
man who had passed me on his way to his garden. His
words returned like black birds flying heavily round my
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not in the right way. Places are states of
mind. In this way you will have much need of self-defence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Arima’s words also. “There is no guide. There
is only power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Power. That brought the Abbot to my mind—the Rules.
Could it be that they could rescue me from this horrible
country where evil hid like a snake behind every stone. O,
to be out of it—free—forgetting! I remember I fell on
my knees as if in prayer and with dreadful earnestness
began to repeat the Rules, passionately desiring the garden
of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no parents. I make the heaven and the earth
my parents. I have no weapons—I make submission my
strength.” Light broke in my brain. Submission? Then
should I dictate—should I trust myself to my own choice
of where I would be? Arima had warned me against return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had used what we call ‘extension’ and had
gone on you would have been on the other side of the
mountain.” If there were to be refuge for such as I it
could only lie along the way of courage. I knew it—I
knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I changed my thought instantly. “Set me where
I should be if it is in the gateway of hell.” And again.
“Only free me of myself. Let me go forward. There is
no sin like cowardice. Better lust and murder and the
fight to the death with them than cowardice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with an intensity that shook me like a leaf in storm
I uttered the words of power, hiding my face in a very passion
of belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiet. I lifted my face and looked about me for the
terrible way I had accepted. I was lying on the broken
steps ascending to the monastery and the House Built upon
Clouds at Naniwa. And it was dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wonder of peace! The sun had not yet out-soared
the eastern trees and every bough dropped dew to the
glittering grass. A bird, its little clenching feet on a blossomed
twig beside me, sang like all the bliss of heaven. In
a pool at my feet the lotus, child of the clear cold stream,
raised rosy chalices to the sky and from it ran a stream
divinely clear and bright. The sun might have been the
first that ever shone upon a perfected world untroubled
by man, so clear and clean the water-gold of the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood up and looked about me drawing deep breaths
of purity. Above me beneath a great tree, lost in contemplation,
sat the Abbot Gyōsen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stumbled towards him. I remember I said: “I have
come,” and that he motioned with his hand to a place beside
him. Together we watched the slow crescendo of the mighty
music of the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was above the trees when he spoke, turning the
serenity of his face upon me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have learnt your lesson. Has it brought content?”
I summoned my thoughts to reply clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have learnt much but the truth I do not know. Does
the corpse still lie on the moor and the woman weep in the
deserted house. Am I guilty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your soul, yes. Therefore in truth, yes. When you
yielded to lust in your heart and willed murder both were
accomplished. Your own Scriptures teach this and that
thought is the only true reality. This have all the Buddhas
known. In what men ignorantly call fact you are not
guilty. But, being guilty, learn this. Every instant terminates
a life and the next is a new birth. While each minute
exists the past is dead and the future unmade. I speak
here according to the knowledge of this world, but the
truth is that there is <span class='it'>no</span> time, and that you are now what
the Divine sees you—a ray of his splendour. This truth
being as yet too high for you to remember that even on this
world’s showing you are free to be what you will. The
choice lies before you. With a thought you may be in the
horror of the Desolate Country, with another in the Shining
Land. For every man makes his own universe until he can
see it as it is in the Thought of the Divine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blinded with truth I asked a question simply as a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what must I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Resolve and go forward,—what else? knowing that in
yourself is all power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the training? Free me from myself! If we can
realize these powers the means of using so terrible a weapon
rightly should be open to all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is open. But men will not believe. They will not
will. They do not think, and events take them like sea-weed
on a wave. You know your own weakness but it is strength
compared with that of the majority. You, at least, have
seen and heard. Study the teachings of the perfect One,
the Buddha, if you would be a man. Realize your union
with Power, knowing that it is a harp of many strings of
which you are one, and tune yourself in harmony with the
music of the spheres. At present you are a man without
a sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That phrase! It kindled a world of recollection. I
looked into his face with another entreaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arima sama told me that I might hear the end of the
story of the Man without a Sword from your honourable
self. Tell it to me, I beseech you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and invited me to follow him into the House
Built upon Clouds promising that he would rejoin me when
he had transacted some necessary business. I sat in the
window looking out and down into the glorious depth of
waving woods bathing in sunshine like water, experiencing
myself such tranquil joy as the trees themselves must know,
fulfilling their perfect Law in the smile of the Divine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long before the Abbot returned, but to me it seemed
a moment. We have no true means of measuring time for
the truth is that it has no existence, and when the soul is
liberated this truth is evident. At once he began the story
of the Man without a Sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Japan very terrible was the position of the man who
had lost his sword. Better a thousand deaths of lingering
torture. There was no man so low as to give him companionship—and
he a noble! Therefore he changed his name
to that of Kazuma, and casting aside what money was left
he abandoned his wife who was dying of grief and shame,
and coming to Yedo took up the study of jujutsu hoping
some day to become a teacher of this in the great city.
More lonely a man could not be than Kazuma. His wife
died. His son was taken by his brother and he saw him no
more. His own name was blotted out and forgotten. His
brother believed and hoped him dead, and but for the command
of his foe he would have killed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jujutsu, my son, is, as you know from Arima sama, an
art that every noble person should learn. It is said to have
come from China, and it was taught that the very Gods
had used it in chastising the barbarians. The name roughly
signifies ‘the strength of weakness,’ and thus it arose. It
was noted that the boughs of a willow were not broken by a
heavy fall of snow when strong trees cracked beneath the
weight. And why? Being pliant they bowed their weakness
and the snow slipped off. My son, recall the Rule.
‘I have no strength. I make submission my strength.’
As with the soul so it is with the body. How shall I sum
up this art of attack and self-defence? It is the perfect
control of the mind resisting defeat. It is to use weakness
in such a way that it masters brute strength. I have seen
a slight woman who possessed this knowledge fling a heavy
man over her shoulder and stun him. There are locks and
blows which may easily kill the opponent and for this
reason the higher secrets are withheld from all but those
who are fit for initiation. The pupils are trained to endure
heat and cold and all hardships. It is a high and noble
discipline, for no greatness can be attained without abstinence
from the three vices of lust, drink, and the love of
money with their attendant diseases of the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This art Kazuma studied, and as he did so much became
clear to him and he approached the secret of life. And
when he had reached a certain skill his master taught him
that there is in jujutsu a higher branch of mysterious power.
And he, beginning dimly to apprehend the meaning of the
command laid on him by the husband of the woman he had
slain, for so indeed he had, desired with eagerness to advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my son, at the gate of this higher initiation stands
a ceremony to be endured. The initiate must submit to
strangulation and to be revived by <span class='it'>kwappo</span>—the art which
recalls men to life. And should this fail, revival is made by
means of a power named <span class='it'>kiai</span>. To Kazuma, knowing nothing
of <span class='it'>kiai</span>, but very weary of life, this command came like
the friendly voice of death, and with joy he presented himself
to the master of the art who was chosen to be his executioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lay down, offering his throat, and in a few seconds
was what is called dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, being thus enfranchised, instantly he found himself
in the place of his humiliation by the rushing river, with
cold desolation about him. And by the river knelt his
conqueror washing the blood from his hands as though
their fight was but just ended. He rose and faced Kazuma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have obeyed my command.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I have obeyed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What have you learnt?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That there is no death. It is more life, but life as we
have made it. As a man has sown he reaps in life after
life.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Until what time?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Until the time when he sows good grain.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do you repent your past?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not look back. I go forward. It is forgotten.
The man who did the deed died with it. Now I would be
a teacher of jujutsu.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well said! You have learnt to defend yourself from
yourself and you would teach others. I will give you fresh
orders.’ Kazuma stood like a soldier before his general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Teach what you have learnt. Then come back, and in
this place of desolation where you fought and conquered
more than you knew make a garden and build a bridge.
Go now,—in power!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He bowed low, Kazuma also. ‘My friend!’— As the
words met his ear they melted in a confused murmur
of human voices and he struggled back to consciousness
in the school of jujutsu in Yedo. Men knelt and
stooped about him fearful lest he had gone so far
on the way of death that even the powerful shout of
<span class='it'>kiai</span> could not reach him. But he rose and gravely thanking
his executioner went and stood before his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son, Kazuma became the greatest teacher of jujutsu
in Japan. He could disarm and bring to his feet a two-sworded
man shrieking for mercy. With his shout he could
do to death any evil-doer within hearing and restore the
fool when he had mastered his lesson. Power was mighty
in his step, his gesture, his glance. What money he made,
and it was much, was for those who had need, he himself
living in an untouchable content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus time went by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day, having saved the life of the only son of a noble
house, the father coming to him said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My lord, what shall I give you? In mercy accept
a gift lest I and my house break under the weight of
gratitude. Have pity and take!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, after much musing, Kazuma replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have bought great lands by the river Koga. I
grow old. Give me, my lord, if you will, a corner by the
river, very small, where I may make a garden and build a
wooden bridge for those who must cross the rapids. Very
dangerous is the current.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it was done and he made his garden and built with his
own hands a bridge of wood, and there was no day but the
people blessed his name and learnt from him that power lies
about them for the taking and that its best use at the present
time is to make gardens and be a builder of bridges. Other
uses later. My son, Kazuma still walks in his garden and
he sits beneath his willow and his sword hangs at his side.
The bridge leads where you know, for you have crossed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence and it spoke as never yet
words. He resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son, make your own garden. And there is room
for many bridges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my mind dwells on beauty the face of the Abbot
full of unworded meanings floats on clear air before me. It
ended and completed the story so that all he left unsaid was
written in fire between the spoken words. And I understood
and like himself cannot express more than the alphabet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned from Naniwa by the hidden way. Flowers
blossomed along the moors. I never saw more lovely, and
where the corpse had lain children were dancing in a ring.
Where the broken house had crouched among trees, was
a shrine to the Thousand-Handed Spirit of Mercy beloved in
Japan. A child lay in her bosom and her hidden eyes were
bent upon it in a moonlight rapture. May I live in that
country for the eternities!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I crossed the bridge and walked beside the river to the
garden of Arima. He sat by the water plaiting a basket of
willow, and rose, bowing, to meet me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come,” I said, “to learn jujutsu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have learnt it and with it the secret of power. I go in
and out of Kazuma’s garden. And beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Abbot, who was once Kazuma, and will be more,
sits there, girded with his sword.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
